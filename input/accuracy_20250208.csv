"FIGHT FOR PEACE INTERNATIONAL Primary goal (Comic Relief): Children and young people at risk. Related issues (Comic Relief): NULL. Summary: In Mare favela, one of the most dangerous slums in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, drug-related gun violence is the primary cause of death of young people. Key drivers for youth participation in crime and violence include poverty, low levels of education, social marginalisation, violence from state forces and armed groups, dysfunctional families, and a lack of leisure facilities. This project will extend a tried and tested approach that offers personal development, sports, education and employment opportunities and social support services to vulnerable young people in the favela, enabling young people to realise their full potential and increasing social cohesion and peace in the target communities.

"APPUI AUX FAMILLES MILITAIRES DES CAMPS DE KINDU (2IÈME PHASE) ET LOKANDU - FAMIKI II/FAMILO België heeft militaire partnerschappen (Programme de Partenariat Militaire - PPM), met verschillende landen in Afrika, teneinde er ter plaatse de hervorming van de veiligheidssector te ondersteunen en mee te werken aan de oprichting van een professioneel nationaal leger, dat ten diensten staat van haar bevolking en de mensenrechten eerbiedigt. Het militaire partnerschap met de Democratische Republiek Congo omvat vooral de vorming van, toezicht op en evaluatie van een 'URR' brigade (Unité de Réaction Rapide  - een soort paracommando's) bestaande uit drie elite bataljons (321e, 322e en 323e Bataillons de Réaction Rapide) te Kindu, naast de vorming, de begeleiding en evaluatie van de onderrichters van de Militaire Academie van Kananga en van de Genieschool in Likasi. Het 321e bataljon werd eind 2008-begin 2009 gevormd te Kananga, het 322e bataljon eind 2011-begin 2012 te Kindu en tenslotte het 323e bataljon in de loop van 2013 te Kindu. Blijft nog de vorming van de staf van de brigade die de drie gevormde elite bataljons zal omkaderen. Wanneer een militair in de Democratische Republiek Congo een standplaats krijgt toegewezen om er tijdelijk te verblijven, trekt zijn gezin bijna altijd mee. Deze verplaatsingen resulteren vaak in moeilijke levensomstandigheden voor de families. Die families dienen op zoek te gaan naar een onderkomen, naar gezondheidszorgen, naar een school voor hun kinderen en naar landbouwgrond om voedsel te kunnen produceren. Dit gebeurt vaak ten koste van de lokale populatie met conflicten als gevolg. Om aan deze tendens een halt toe te roepen, willen de Congolese regering en de Stafdienst van het leger (FARDC – Forces Armées de la République Démocratique du Congo) de militairen en hun gezin een vaste woonplaats bezorgen. Het is de bedoeling de militairen te huisvesten in garnizoensteden verspreid over het hele land. Zo zullen de militairen die op missie vertrekken, gerust gesteld zijn dat hun familie veilig en degelijk gehuisvest is.Kindu gelegen in de provincie Maniema is één van die garnizoensteden. De drie door België opgeleide bataljons worden gehuisvest te Kindu en omgeving, meer bepaald het 321e bataljon in het militaire kamp Lwama, het 322e bataljon in het militaire kamp Lokandu en het 323e bataljon in het militaire kamp Jericho.Nu bevonden deze militaire kampen zich in een lamentabele toestand wegens verwaarlozing ingevolge de oorlogen die de DRC de laatste jaren had gekend.

The main goal is to enhance the role of Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) in decision-making processes related to housing. This involves enabling local groups to have more influence in shaping policies or actions that impact their communities' housing conditions.

The emphasis on strengthening homeowners associations indicates an interest in promoting community-driven initiatives, which may relate to incremental improvements and participation in the housing sector. The reform-oriented nature of the project also suggests an element of structural or policy enhancement within the existing housing framework rather than addressing homelessness or providing transitional shelters.

Since the text explicitly mentions efforts related to decision-making processes in the housing sector, it falls under the 'Housing' classification. Additionally, due to its focus on community involvement and homeowners associations, there's a strong argument for an 'Incremental' classification, as these groups often engage in neighborhood integration or incremental improvements. Lastly, since this project spans multiple countries with potentially diverse urban and rural settings, both 'Urban' and 'Rural' classifications are relevant.

Thus, the possible classifications are:

The phrase 'les abris' translates directly to 'shelters,' aligning with the definition of the 'Transitional' class as it implies housing solutions like refugee camps or temporary supportive housing. The inclusion of 'articles ménagers essentiels' (essential household items) supports the notion that these shelters are meant for short-term use while providing basic living necessities.

The text does not explicitly mention housing construction, upgrading inadequate housing, or urban/rural location specifics, so it doesn't directly match with 'Housing,' 'Urban,' or 'Rural.'

2. **Transitional**: There is no mention of emergency shelters, refugee camps, or temporary supportive housing. Therefore, this class does not apply to the text.

3. **Incremental**: The project does include building new hostels which can be seen as a form of housing construction that contributes incrementally to solving the shelter needs of specific groups. However, it doesn't specifically mention any incremental improvement or upgrade existing structures but rather focuses on building anew for underserved populations.

4. **Social**: Building hostels and staff houses could fit into social housing if they are meant to be accessible at low cost or managed in a way that serves the community's needs inclusively, particularly because it aims to support poor fishermen and their families. It isn't explicitly labeled as cooperative housing or public housing, but the intention aligns with providing communal benefits.

Una mirada palestina al valle del Jordán :: Desde 1948 el Estado de Israel inició la Nakba, un proceso de desplazamiento forzoso y violento de la población palestina de sus lugares de origen. Esta estrategia que se manifiesta de diferentes maneras (sistema de permisos, zonificación, segregación, confiscación de tierras, denegación de acceso a recursos y servicios, supresión de la resistencia, debilitamiento de la identidad, entre otras) busca el debilitamiento de la identidad nacional y la resistencia colectiva, afectando especialmente el relevo generacional y los mecanismos de resistencia comunitarios. El desplazamiento interno y refugio de la población palestina ha condicionado su acceso a servicios básicos y medios de vida ante la dependencia del mercado de trabajo israelí y la ayuda humanitaria en los campamentos de refugiados. Adicionalmente, su sociedad es ampliamente conservadora y patriarcal, lo cual relega a los jóvenes y mujeres a un segundo plano. Se estima que casi el 30% de la población palestina es joven (15-29 años), pese al alto nivel de alfabetización la juventud debe hacer frente a altas tasas de desempleo (40%), asimismo, las mujeres jóvenes sufren con frecuencia un contexto doblemente opresor de sus derechos y libertades que les impide implicarse y participar en la lucha por la liberación palestina.

"PROMOTING LEGAL EMPOWERMENT OF THE URBAN POOR IN NIGERIA THROUGH AN INTER-CITY COMMUNITY PARALEGAL NETWORK Approximately 67% of urban populations in Nigeria live in informal settlements and are caught in a poverty trap characterized by marginalization and insecurity. Communities lack access to basic services and security of tenure and they face discrimination and threats of physical violence. Ethnic minorities, urban migrants, and women are particularly vulnerable to social and political exclusion. To date, approaches to urban development have emphasized policies of decongestion, formalization of informal settlements, or beautification, which have often resulted in arrests, forced evictions, and demolitions of informal settlement communities. Many people living on the margins of Nigeria's cities have struggled to exercise their basic rights.   Against that backdrop, this project aims to address some of the most critical justice and governance challenges facing Nigeria's urban poor. The research builds on five years of experience of an innovative inter-city network of community paralegals, trained and supported by Justice and Empowerment Initiatives – Nigeria. The network currently serves over 100 informal settlements (slums) in Lagos and Port Harcourt.    The research will comprise three streams. First, the team will identify the priority justice challenges experienced by informal settlement residents, with their direct participation. Another stream will study the immediate costs and longer-term impacts of these justice challenges on residents, with a view to understanding their relationship with the poverty trap. A final stream will explore the broader societal costs of current urban policy approaches and will conduct cost-benefit analyses on proposed alternatives. Research findings will be used to identify and test legal empowerment strategies to improve urban poor communities' capacity to respond to priority justice challenges.

The objectives include increasing technical capacities regarding environmental safeguards, gender inclusion, risks, and climate change, as well as strengthening mechanisms for monitoring these aspects. There are several key points to consider when classifying this description:

1. **Urban**: The text mentions 'urban' explicitly in the context of reducing urban backwardness and discusses initiatives related to urban improvement. This aligns with the definition of activities that occur specifically in urban locations.

2. **Social**: There is a focus on addressing social aspects, such as gender inclusion and potentially improving living conditions for marginalized communities, which could be associated with 'social' efforts aimed at community betterment. However, it does not explicitly mention mechanisms like public housing or cooperative housing directly.

3. **Housing/Incremental**: The Urban Improvement Program (PMU) often involves activities such as slum upgrading and neighborhood integration, falling under the incremental category. These are common components of urban improvement initiatives aimed at enhancing living conditions in cities by improving existing infrastructure rather than providing new housing units outright.

Based on these considerations, 'Urban' clearly applies due to the focus on urban locations. The program's emphasis on technical improvements related to environmental and social issues aligns with 'Incremental' efforts within urban settings, as it implies a phased approach to upgrading existing structures or systems.

- There is no explicit mention of homelessness-related activities such as tents or homeless shelters, ruling out the 'Homelessness' classification.
- No specific incremental housing projects such as slum upgrading or neighborhood integration are described, so it does not qualify under 'Incremental'.
- The text does not explicitly describe community land trusts, cooperative housing, or public housing initiatives which would align with 'Social'.

The sectors mentioned include Food Security and Livelihoods, Protection Shelter and Settlements, WASH (Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene). Given the subsector 'Protection Shelter and Settlements,' this may relate to activities involving temporary or emergency accommodation, shelter provision, or similar initiatives.

The specific locations mentioned are Mardin, Diyarbakir, and Istanbul. Among these, Mardin and Diyarbakir can be considered rural or semi-rural regions, whereas Istanbul is an urban area. This geographical spread includes both urban and potentially rural settings, which aligns with the 'Urban' and 'Rural' classifications.

The mention of 'Protection Shelter and Settlements' in a humanitarian context often relates to addressing immediate needs for shelter following displacement or crisis situations. This could include transitional shelters or facilities such as emergency shelters or refugee camps. Therefore, this suggests potential matches with the 'Transitional' classification due to the nature of protection services typically provided.

No explicit mention is made about permanent housing construction, homelessness services (like homeless shelters), social or market housing types, or incremental upgrading processes like slum rehabilitation. Thus, these classifications seem less likely based on the information provided.

Residents of Africa's urban informal settlements are at elevated risk for poor sexual and reproductive health and rights, unintended pregnancies, unsafe abortion, and sexual and gender-based violence.

While implementers of male-targeted sexual and reproductive health and rights programs in Africa argue that their work is grounded in current international evidence on what works to promote the engagement of men and boys in gender equality and improved sexual and reproductive health and rights, little systematic research exists on the implementation, effectiveness, and effects of these initiatives.   This project will generate and disseminate evidence on the implementation, effectiveness, and challenges of male-targeted sexual and reproductive health and rights and positive masculinity initiatives in poor urban settlements.
