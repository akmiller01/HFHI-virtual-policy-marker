"APPUI AUX FAMILLES MILITAIRES DES CAMPS DE KINDU (2IÈME PHASE) ET LOKANDU - FAMIKI II/FAMILO België heeft militaire partnerschappen (Programme de Partenariat Militaire - PPM), met verschillende landen in Afrika, teneinde er ter plaatse de hervorming van de veiligheidssector te ondersteunen en mee te werken aan de oprichting van een professioneel nationaal leger, dat ten diensten staat van haar bevolking en de mensenrechten eerbiedigt. Het militaire partnerschap met de Democratische Republiek Congo omvat vooral de vorming van, toezicht op en evaluatie van een 'URR' brigade (Unité de Réaction Rapide  - een soort paracommando's) bestaande uit drie elite bataljons (321e, 322e en 323e Bataillons de Réaction Rapide) te Kindu, naast de vorming, de begeleiding en evaluatie van de onderrichters van de Militaire Academie van Kananga en van de Genieschool in Likasi. Het 321e bataljon werd eind 2008-begin 2009 gevormd te Kananga, het 322e bataljon eind 2011-begin 2012 te Kindu en tenslotte het 323e bataljon in de loop van 2013 te Kindu. Blijft nog de vorming van de staf van de brigade die de drie gevormde elite bataljons zal omkaderen. Wanneer een militair in de Democratische Republiek Congo een standplaats krijgt toegewezen om er tijdelijk te verblijven, trekt zijn gezin bijna altijd mee. Deze verplaatsingen resulteren vaak in moeilijke levensomstandigheden voor de families. Die families dienen op zoek te gaan naar een onderkomen, naar gezondheidszorgen, naar een school voor hun kinderen en naar landbouwgrond om voedsel te kunnen produceren. Dit gebeurt vaak ten koste van de lokale populatie met conflicten als gevolg. Om aan deze tendens een halt toe te roepen, willen de Congolese regering en de Stafdienst van het leger (FARDC – Forces Armées de la République Démocratique du Congo) de militairen en hun gezin een vaste woonplaats bezorgen. Het is de bedoeling de militairen te huisvesten in garnizoensteden verspreid over het hele land. Zo zullen de militairen die op missie vertrekken, gerust gesteld zijn dat hun familie veilig en degelijk gehuisvest is.Kindu gelegen in de provincie Maniema is één van die garnizoensteden. De drie door België opgeleide bataljons worden gehuisvest te Kindu en omgeving, meer bepaald het 321e bataljon in het militaire kamp Lwama, het 322e bataljon in het militaire kamp Lokandu en het 323e bataljon in het militaire kamp Jericho.Nu bevonden deze militaire kampen zich in een lamentabele toestand wegens verwaarlozing ingevolge de oorlogen die de DRC de laatste jaren had gekend. De Belgische defensie in zijn partnerschapsakkoord met de DRC voorziet in de rehabilitatie van de infrastructuur van die kampen maar er waren onvoldoende fondsen voorzien voor de huisvesting van de militairen.

Esta estrategia que se manifiesta de diferentes maneras (sistema de permisos, zonificación, segregación, confiscación de tierras, denegación de acceso a recursos y servicios, supresión de la resistencia, debilitamiento de la identidad, entre otras) busca el debilitamiento de la identidad nacional y la resistencia colectiva, afectando especialmente el relevo generacional y los mecanismos de resistencia comunitarios.

"PROMOTING LEGAL EMPOWERMENT OF THE URBAN POOR IN NIGERIA THROUGH AN INTER-CITY COMMUNITY PARALEGAL NETWORK Approximately 67% of urban populations in Nigeria live in informal settlements and are caught in a poverty trap characterized by marginalization and insecurity. Communities lack access to basic services and security of tenure and they face discrimination and threats of physical violence. Ethnic minorities, urban migrants, and women are particularly vulnerable to social and political exclusion. To date, approaches to urban development have emphasized policies of decongestion, formalization of informal settlements, or beautification, which have often resulted in arrests, forced evictions, and demolitions of informal settlement communities. Many people living on the margins of Nigeria's cities have struggled to exercise their basic rights.   Against that backdrop, this project aims to address some of the most critical justice and governance challenges facing Nigeria's urban poor. The research builds on five years of experience of an innovative inter-city network of community paralegals, trained and supported by Justice and Empowerment Initiatives – Nigeria. The network currently serves over 100 informal settlements (slums) in Lagos and Port Harcourt.    The research will comprise three streams. First, the team will identify the priority justice challenges experienced by informal settlement residents, with their direct participation. Another stream will study the immediate costs and longer-term impacts of these justice challenges on residents, with a view to understanding their relationship with the poverty trap. A final stream will explore the broader societal costs of current urban policy approaches and will conduct cost-benefit analyses on proposed alternatives.

"IMPROVING ENERGY EFFICIENCY IN THE BUILDING SECTOR THROUGH THE USE OF RENEWABLE RAW MATERIALS FROM AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS The project has two main objectives: (a) increasing energy efficiency in the housing sector and (b) providing a local source of sustainable building and insulation materials to substitute fossil-based materials and wood imports. The main target groups of the project are manufacturers, construction companies, and farmers. Through the cooperation with wood processing companies in Uzbekistan, long-term impulses for the sustainable development of the timber construction sector are being set in the local business environment. Key stakeholders as well as a broader audience will be reached through training and e-learning modules for vocational and higher education and by constructing a model house. The project activities are organized into three threads. The first one focuses on analyzing the current situation and capacities of the wood processing industry and how to improve it. In the second thread we design a building system based on local materials and construct an affordable model house, bearing in mind contemporary needs for climate-adaptive architecture, local building traditions as well as challenges related to the use of renewable energies.

"Project title: Multi-sectoral Rapid Response Mechanism to Support Crisis-affected Populations in Sudan, Sector: Coordination Disaster Risk Reduction / Disaster Preparedness Health Multi-purpose cash transfer Shelter and settlements WASH, Subsector: N/A, E",72010,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,"The project title refers to a multi-sectoral response mechanism aimed at supporting crisis-affected populations in Sudan. The mention of 'shelter and settlements' indicates a focus on housing, which aligns with the definition of the housing sector. This could involve the provision of temporary shelter or upgrading existing housing conditions for those affected by crises. However, without more specific details about the nature of the shelter being provided (e.g., whether it is transitional, social, or incremental), it is difficult to classify it further. There is no mention of homelessness or transitional housing specifically, but the context suggests that there may be elements of transitional housing involved, especially in a crisis setting. Overall, the primary classification that fits is 'Housing' due to the focus on shelter and settlements.",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

EBRD CONTRIBUTION TO THE CHERNOBYL SHELTER FUND EBRD Beitrag zum Tschernobyl Shelter Fund,23510,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"The title 'EBRD CONTRIBUTION TO THE CHERNOBYL SHELTER FUND' suggests a focus on a fund related to shelter, particularly in the context of the Chernobyl disaster. The term 'shelter' could imply a connection to housing, especially in emergency situations. However, without additional context or details about the specific activities funded by this contribution, it is difficult to definitively classify it under the housing sector. The term 'shelter' could potentially relate to transitional housing or homelessness if it involves providing temporary housing solutions for affected individuals. However, the lack of explicit mention of these aspects makes it challenging to classify it firmly. Therefore, the most relevant classification appears to be 'Transitional' due to the implication of providing shelter in a post-disaster context.",False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False
