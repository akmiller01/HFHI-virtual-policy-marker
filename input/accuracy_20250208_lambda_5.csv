"FIGHT FOR PEACE INTERNATIONAL Primary goal (Comic Relief): Children and young people at risk. Related issues (Comic Relief): NULL. Summary: In Mare favela, one of the most dangerous slums in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, drug-related gun violence is the primary cause of death of young people. Key drivers for youth participation in crime and violence include poverty, low levels of education, social marginalisation, violence from state forces and armed groups, dysfunctional families, and a lack of leisure facilities. This project will extend a tried and tested approach that offers personal development, sports, education and employment opportunities and social support services to vulnerable young people in the favela, enabling young people to realise their full potential and increasing social cohesion and peace in the target communities.

3. **Transitional**: While the project addresses vulnerable populations, it does not explicitly describe emergency shelters, refugee camps, or temporary supportive housing.

5. **Social**: There are components related to community engagement such as personal development, sports, education, and employment opportunities, but not specifically tied to concepts like community land trusts or cooperative housing.

6. **Market**: The description does not involve market-rate housing, mortgages, rent-to-own schemes, or home rentals.

7. **Urban**: The activity is explicitly set in a favela in Rio de Janeiro, which is an urban location. This aligns well with the classification of 'Urban'.

"APPUI AUX FAMILLES MILITAIRES DES CAMPS DE KINDU (2IÈME PHASE) ET LOKANDU - FAMIKI II/FAMILO België heeft militaire partnerschappen (Programme de Partenariat Militaire - PPM), met verschillende landen in Afrika, teneinde er ter plaatse de hervorming van de veiligheidssector te ondersteunen en mee te werken aan de oprichting van een professioneel nationaal leger, dat ten diensten staat van haar bevolking en de mensenrechten eerbiedigt. Het militaire partnerschap met de Democratische Republiek Congo omvat vooral de vorming van, toezicht op en evaluatie van een 'URR' brigade (Unité de Réaction Rapide  - een soort paracommando's) bestaande uit drie elite bataljons (321e, 322e en 323e Bataillons de Réaction Rapide) te Kindu, naast de vorming, de begeleiding en evaluatie van de onderrichters van de Militaire Academie van Kananga en van de Genieschool in Likasi. Het 321e bataljon werd eind 2008-begin 2009 gevormd te Kananga, het 322e bataljon eind 2011-begin 2012 te Kindu en tenslotte het 323e bataljon in de loop van 2013 te Kindu. Blijft nog de vorming van de staf van de brigade die de drie gevormde elite bataljons zal omkaderen. Wanneer een militair in de Democratische Republiek Congo een standplaats krijgt toegewezen om er tijdelijk te verblijven, trekt zijn gezin bijna altijd mee. Deze verplaatsingen resulteren vaak in moeilijke levensomstandigheden voor de families. Die families dienen op zoek te gaan naar een onderkomen, naar gezondheidszorgen, naar een school voor hun kinderen en naar landbouwgrond om voedsel te kunnen produceren. Dit gebeurt vaak ten koste van de lokale populatie met conflicten als gevolg. Om aan deze tendens een halt toe te roepen, willen de Congolese regering en de Stafdienst van het leger (FARDC – Forces Armées de la République Démocratique du Congo) de militairen en hun gezin een vaste woonplaats bezorgen. Het is de bedoeling de militairen te huisvesten in garnizoensteden verspreid over het hele land. Zo zullen de militairen die op missie vertrekken, gerust gesteld zijn dat hun familie veilig en degelijk gehuisvest is.Kindu gelegen in de provincie Maniema is één van die garnizoensteden. De drie door België opgeleide bataljons worden gehuisvest te Kindu en omgeving, meer bepaald het 321e bataljon in het militaire kamp Lwama, het 322e bataljon in het militaire kamp Lokandu en het 323e bataljon in het militaire kamp Jericho.Nu bevonden deze militaire kampen zich in een lamentabele toestand wegens verwaarlozing ingevolge de oorlogen die de DRC de laatste jaren had gekend.

"2022-LANK-25. BRIDGES AND RESILIENCE. A PALESTINIAN LOOK AT THE JORDAN VALLEY Título completo del proyecto: 2022-LANK-25.  Puentes y resiliencia. Una mirada palestina al valle del Jordán :: Desde 1948 el Estado de Israel inició la Nakba, un proceso de desplazamiento forzoso y violento de la población palestina de sus lugares de origen. Esta estrategia que se manifiesta de diferentes maneras (sistema de permisos, zonificación, segregación, confiscación de tierras, denegación de acceso a recursos y servicios, supresión de la resistencia, debilitamiento de la identidad, entre otras) busca el debilitamiento de la identidad nacional y la resistencia colectiva, afectando especialmente el relevo generacional y los mecanismos de resistencia comunitarios. El desplazamiento interno y refugio de la población palestina ha condicionado su acceso a servicios básicos y medios de vida ante la dependencia del mercado de trabajo israelí y la ayuda humanitaria en los campamentos de refugiados. Adicionalmente, su sociedad es ampliamente conservadora y patriarcal, lo cual relega a los jóvenes y mujeres a un segundo plano. Se estima que casi el 30% de la población palestina es joven (15-29 años), pese al alto nivel de alfabetización la juventud debe hacer frente a altas tasas de desempleo (40%), asimismo, las mujeres jóvenes sufren con frecuencia un contexto doblemente opresor de sus derechos y libertades que les impide implicarse y participar en la lucha por la liberación palestina. El proyecto contará con la participación de 7 organizaciones y tiene como objetivo ?Organizaciones Comunitarias (CBOs) de jóvenes, mujeres, refugiados/as y desplazados/as internos/as fortalecen sus lazos, su identidad y sus estrategias de resistencia colectiva frente a las políticas israelíes de segregación y desposesión?.",15160,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,"The project title and description mention activities related to the Jordan Valley involving Palestinian communities dealing with displacement and issues of access to services, particularly in contexts affected by Israeli policies.

"PROMOTING LEGAL EMPOWERMENT OF THE URBAN POOR IN NIGERIA THROUGH AN INTER-CITY COMMUNITY PARALEGAL NETWORK Approximately 67% of urban populations in Nigeria live in informal settlements and are caught in a poverty trap characterized by marginalization and insecurity. Communities lack access to basic services and security of tenure and they face discrimination and threats of physical violence. Ethnic minorities, urban migrants, and women are particularly vulnerable to social and political exclusion. To date, approaches to urban development have emphasized policies of decongestion, formalization of informal settlements, or beautification, which have often resulted in arrests, forced evictions, and demolitions of informal settlement communities. Many people living on the margins of Nigeria's cities have struggled to exercise their basic rights.   Against that backdrop, this project aims to address some of the most critical justice and governance challenges facing Nigeria's urban poor. The research builds on five years of experience of an innovative inter-city network of community paralegals, trained and supported by Justice and Empowerment Initiatives – Nigeria. The network currently serves over 100 informal settlements (slums) in Lagos and Port Harcourt.    The research will comprise three streams. First, the team will identify the priority justice challenges experienced by informal settlement residents, with their direct participation. Another stream will study the immediate costs and longer-term impacts of these justice challenges on residents, with a view to understanding their relationship with the poverty trap. A final stream will explore the broader societal costs of current urban policy approaches and will conduct cost-benefit analyses on proposed alternatives. Research findings will be used to identify and test legal empowerment strategies to improve urban poor communities' capacity to respond to priority justice challenges.

Residents of Africa's urban informal settlements are at elevated risk for poor sexual and reproductive health and rights, unintended pregnancies, unsafe abortion, and sexual and gender-based violence.    Interventions focused on men and boys expand the scope for challenging gender norms and masculine ideals that impede sexual and reproductive health and rights and sustain gender inequality in these communities. While implementers of male-targeted sexual and reproductive health and rights programs in Africa argue that their work is grounded in current international evidence on what works to promote the engagement of men and boys in gender equality and improved sexual and reproductive health and rights, little systematic research exists on the implementation, effectiveness, and effects of these initiatives.   This project will generate and disseminate evidence on the implementation, effectiveness, and challenges of male-targeted sexual and reproductive health and rights and positive masculinity initiatives in poor urban settlements. It will assess gender attitudes, norms, and practices as well as the sexual and reproductive health and rights behaviours of men and boys participating in these programs.
