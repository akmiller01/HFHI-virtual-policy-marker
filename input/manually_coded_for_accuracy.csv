"FIGHT FOR PEACE INTERNATIONAL Primary goal (Comic Relief): Children and young people at risk. Related issues (Comic Relief): NULL. Summary: In Mare favela, one of the most dangerous slums in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, drug-related gun violence is the primary cause of death of young people. Key drivers for youth participation in crime and violence include poverty, low levels of education, social marginalisation, violence from state forces and armed groups, dysfunctional families, and a lack of leisure facilities. This project will extend a tried and tested approach that offers personal development, sports, education and employment opportunities and social support services to vulnerable young people in the favela, enabling young people to realise their full potential and increasing social cohesion and peace in the target communities. Full grant commitment: GBP 468 thousand.",11330,"The project described by FIGHT FOR PEACE INTERNATIONAL addresses children and young people at risk of involvement in crime due to various socio-economic factors within a favela, an urban informal settlement in Rio de Janeiro. The initiative offers personal development, sports, education, employment opportunities, and social support services to combat these issues. Here's the analysis based on each potential classification:

- **Housing**: The text does not explicitly mention housing provision or shelter improvements but focuses more on community-based interventions.
- **Homelessness**: There is no explicit description of homelessness-related infrastructure like tents, encampments, or shelters in this project.
- **Transitional**: Emergency shelters or temporary housing solutions are not mentioned here.
- **Incremental**: The project does mention activities that could relate to incremental improvement, such as neighborhood integration and community development, but there's no explicit reference to housing sites, slum upgrading, or structural repairs.
- **Social**: There's a focus on social support services and improving social cohesion, which aligns with the broader concept of social initiatives. However, specific terms like 'community land trusts,' 'cooperative housing,' or 'public housing' are not mentioned.
- **Market**: The project does not involve market-rate housing, mortgages, or home rental solutions.
- **Urban**: It is explicitly described that this project takes place in a favela (an informal urban settlement) within Rio de Janeiro. This clearly fits the urban classification.
- **Rural**: There's no mention of rural activities; the setting is specifically an urban area.

The focus is on leveraging existing historical, natural, and touristic assets in both urban and rural settings of the Imerti region.

The text does not mention any housing-specific activities directly such as construction, provision of shelter, or improvements to living conditions that would classify it under 'Housing.' There are no mentions of addressing homelessness (such as shelters for the homeless) nor transitional housing solutions like emergency or temporary shelters. Incremental development is also not explicitly covered, though some might argue aspects like local service improvement could fit into broader interpretations of incremental changes.

The project does not specifically address social housing initiatives such as community land trusts or cooperative housing. There's no mention of market-oriented activities like mortgages or rent-to-own housing schemes that would align with 'Market.' Urban-specific development is implied by the reference to Kutaisi, a large city in the region, but it doesn't focus exclusively on urban areas, considering both potential rural and urban attractions are highlighted.

The project's main focus seems to be on tourism development which ties closely with economic enhancement rather than housing or shelter.

- **Homelessness**: There is no mention or implication of tents, encampments, or shelters specifically for homeless individuals. Therefore, it does not fit this category.
- **Transitional**: The text does not describe any form of emergency shelters, refugee camps, or temporary housing solutions typically associated with transitional contexts.
- **Incremental**: While the project involves some financial support and contributions from beneficiaries (labor), it doesn't explicitly mention slum upgrading or neighborhood integration, so this class is less directly applicable.
- **Social**: The project supports low-income families but does not describe community land trusts, cooperative housing, or public housing arrangements. Therefore, it may not fit perfectly into this category.
- **Market**: There's no reference to market-based mechanisms like home-rental, mortgages, or rent-to-own options in the description, so this class is not applicable.
- **Urban**: The construction occurs in a rural area within Haliyal taluk, which does not qualify as urban. Thus, it doesn't fit into this classification.
- **Rural**: Given that the location specified is in southern India's Uttara Kannada district and is described with reference to rural administration (taluk), this aligns well with a rural setting.

SYR L4S FOOD SHELTER DESTITUTE FAMILIES,72040,"The description 'SYR L4S FOOD SHIELD DESTITUTE FAMILIES' suggests a focus on providing food and shelter to needy families, likely those experiencing homelessness or extreme poverty. The use of the term 'SHIELD' may indicate emergency or temporary accommodations provided for families without stable housing. Given this context, it is most relevant to classes related to providing immediate support in terms of housing and addressing situations of homelessness.

- **Housing:** While the description doesn't directly mention construction or policy aspects typical of broader housing initiatives, the provision of shelter as part of aid implies involvement with the housing sector.
- **Homelessness:** The term 'DESTITUTE FAMILIES' strongly indicates that this initiative targets those who lack permanent housing, fitting well within the definition of addressing homelessness. Providing shelters would directly correlate to efforts against homelessness.
- **Transitional:** If the shelter is meant as a temporary solution on the way to more stable living arrangements, it could align with transitional support.

An estimated 5.7 million people are either displaced within the country or have sought refuge in Ecuador and Venezuela. Consequences of the conflict include forced displacement, limited mobility of people, goods and services, forced recruitment of children and young people by armed groups, as well as, sexual and gender-based violence. In 2014, 1.4 million people had limited access to basic and public services. 4.8 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance, including access to safe water, adequate sanitation and hygiene systems, health care services in rural areas, protection, as well as timely food assistance and nutritional support.   With DFATD's support, Action Against Hunger is addressing the basic water, sanitation and hygiene needs of 15,000 conflict-affected people in the department of NariÃ±o.

"APPUI AUX FAMILLES MILITAIRES DES CAMPS DE KINDU (2IÈME PHASE) ET LOKANDU - FAMIKI II/FAMILO België heeft militaire partnerschappen (Programme de Partenariat Militaire - PPM), met verschillende landen in Afrika, teneinde er ter plaatse de hervorming van de veiligheidssector te ondersteunen en mee te werken aan de oprichting van een professioneel nationaal leger, dat ten diensten staat van haar bevolking en de mensenrechten eerbiedigt. Het militaire partnerschap met de Democratische Republiek Congo omvat vooral de vorming van, toezicht op en evaluatie van een 'URR' brigade (Unité de Réaction Rapide  - een soort paracommando's) bestaande uit drie elite bataljons (321e, 322e en 323e Bataillons de Réaction Rapide) te Kindu, naast de vorming, de begeleiding en evaluatie van de onderrichters van de Militaire Academie van Kananga en van de Genieschool in Likasi. Het 321e bataljon werd eind 2008-begin 2009 gevormd te Kananga, het 322e bataljon eind 2011-begin 2012 te Kindu en tenslotte het 323e bataljon in de loop van 2013 te Kindu. Blijft nog de vorming van de staf van de brigade die de drie gevormde elite bataljons zal omkaderen. Wanneer een militair in de Democratische Republiek Congo een standplaats krijgt toegewezen om er tijdelijk te verblijven, trekt zijn gezin bijna altijd mee. Deze verplaatsingen resulteren vaak in moeilijke levensomstandigheden voor de families. Die families dienen op zoek te gaan naar een onderkomen, naar gezondheidszorgen, naar een school voor hun kinderen en naar landbouwgrond om voedsel te kunnen produceren. Dit gebeurt vaak ten koste van de lokale populatie met conflicten als gevolg. Om aan deze tendens een halt toe te roepen, willen de Congolese regering en de Stafdienst van het leger (FARDC – Forces Armées de la République Démocratique du Congo) de militairen en hun gezin een vaste woonplaats bezorgen. Het is de bedoeling de militairen te huisvesten in garnizoensteden verspreid over het hele land. Zo zullen de militairen die op missie vertrekken, gerust gesteld zijn dat hun familie veilig en degelijk gehuisvest is.Kindu gelegen in de provincie Maniema is één van die garnizoensteden. De drie door België opgeleide bataljons worden gehuisvest te Kindu en omgeving, meer bepaald het 321e bataljon in het militaire kamp Lwama, het 322e bataljon in het militaire kamp Lokandu en het 323e bataljon in het militaire kamp Jericho.Nu bevonden deze militaire kampen zich in een lamentabele toestand wegens verwaarlozing ingevolge de oorlogen die de DRC de laatste jaren had gekend. De Belgische defensie in zijn partnerschapsakkoord met de DRC voorziet in de rehabilitatie van de infrastructuur van die kampen maar er waren onvoldoende fondsen voorzien voor de huisvesting van de militairen. Bijgevolg werd aan onze FOD Buitenlandse Zaken, Buitenlandse Handel en Ontwikkelingssamenwerking in het kader van een 3D benadering (défence, diplomatie et développement) gevraagd financieel bij te dragen voor de rehabilitatie van de huisvesting in deze kampen.

Una mirada palestina al valle del Jordán :: Desde 1948 el Estado de Israel inició la Nakba, un proceso de desplazamiento forzoso y violento de la población palestina de sus lugares de origen. Esta estrategia que se manifiesta de diferentes maneras (sistema de permisos, zonificación, segregación, confiscación de tierras, denegación de acceso a recursos y servicios, supresión de la resistencia, debilitamiento de la identidad, entre otras) busca el debilitamiento de la identidad nacional y la resistencia colectiva, afectando especialmente el relevo generacional y los mecanismos de resistencia comunitarios. El desplazamiento interno y refugio de la población palestina ha condicionado su acceso a servicios básicos y medios de vida ante la dependencia del mercado de trabajo israelí y la ayuda humanitaria en los campamentos de refugiados. Adicionalmente, su sociedad es ampliamente conservadora y patriarcal, lo cual relega a los jóvenes y mujeres a un segundo plano. Se estima que casi el 30% de la población palestina es joven (15-29 años), pese al alto nivel de alfabetización la juventud debe hacer frente a altas tasas de desempleo (40%), asimismo, las mujeres jóvenes sufren con frecuencia un contexto doblemente opresor de sus derechos y libertades que les impide implicarse y participar en la lucha por la liberación palestina. El proyecto contará con la participación de 7 organizaciones y tiene como objetivo ?Organizaciones Comunitarias (CBOs) de jóvenes, mujeres, refugiados/as y desplazados/as internos/as fortalecen sus lazos, su identidad y sus estrategias de resistencia colectiva frente a las políticas israelíes de segregación y desposesión?.",15160,"The project description provided outlines an initiative in the Jordan Valley focusing on Palestinian resilience and community organization against policies of segregation and dispossession.

Additionally, it emphasizes the role of conservative social structures that marginalize young people and women. The primary goal is for community-based organizations (CBOs) involving youth, women, refugees, and internally displaced persons to strengthen their ties, identity, and collective resistance strategies.

The project operates within an urban context as it deals with population groups often residing in cities or urban-like environments where displacement impacts are prominent.

"PROMOTING LEGAL EMPOWERMENT OF THE URBAN POOR IN NIGERIA THROUGH AN INTER-CITY COMMUNITY PARALEGAL NETWORK Approximately 67% of urban populations in Nigeria live in informal settlements and are caught in a poverty trap characterized by marginalization and insecurity. Communities lack access to basic services and security of tenure and they face discrimination and threats of physical violence. Ethnic minorities, urban migrants, and women are particularly vulnerable to social and political exclusion. To date, approaches to urban development have emphasized policies of decongestion, formalization of informal settlements, or beautification, which have often resulted in arrests, forced evictions, and demolitions of informal settlement communities. Many people living on the margins of Nigeria's cities have struggled to exercise their basic rights.   Against that backdrop, this project aims to address some of the most critical justice and governance challenges facing Nigeria's urban poor. The research builds on five years of experience of an innovative inter-city network of community paralegals, trained and supported by Justice and Empowerment Initiatives – Nigeria. The network currently serves over 100 informal settlements (slums) in Lagos and Port Harcourt.    The research will comprise three streams. First, the team will identify the priority justice challenges experienced by informal settlement residents, with their direct participation. Another stream will study the immediate costs and longer-term impacts of these justice challenges on residents, with a view to understanding their relationship with the poverty trap. A final stream will explore the broader societal costs of current urban policy approaches and will conduct cost-benefit analyses on proposed alternatives. Research findings will be used to identify and test legal empowerment strategies to improve urban poor communities' capacity to respond to priority justice challenges.

"F.A: STRENGTHENING YOUTH VOICE FOR CIVIC ACTION The young people in Uganda have the know-how, passion, drive, and dynamism to provoke significant change around them. Yet, they are rarely included in civic dialogue, poorly represented in political spaces, and all too often sidelined from decision making. The civic and political participation of Ugandan youth is hindered by lack of political will, mistrusts between youth and duty bearers and socio-economic constraints such as unemployment. The overall objective is to contribute to a peaceful Ugandan society where young men and women actively contribute to transformation of conflicts, maintenance of peace, and socio-economic development of their communities. The expected result is improved capacity of youth to lead actions against the root causes of conflict and violence in their communities. Furthermore, the capacity of networks and youth-led organisations is strengthened to participate in decision making and influence policy discourse. The project also aims to enhance capacity of local duty bearers in state and non-state institutions to engage actively with the youth and play a more active role in enabling youth aspirations.      Right-holders/beneficiaries: 10,060 youth (50% M and 50% F) and indirectly 20, 000 young people between 15 and 30 years, including young women, refugee youth, youth with disabilities, youth in schools, youth out of school, youth in grassroot organizations and youth in slum areas.Duty bearers: Local government technical and political leaders, teachers, members of parliament, leaders in CSOs, parents, religious and cultural leaders, women leaders and private sector.

"Promoting positive masculinity for sexual and reproductive health and rights and gender equality in informal settlements in sub-Saharan Africa/Promouvoir une masculinité positive pour la santé qui favorise la santé sexuelle et reproductive, les droits sexuels et l'égalité des sexes PROMOTING POSITIVE MASCULINITY FOR SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH AND RIGHTS AND GENDER EQUALITY IN INFORMAL SETTLEMENTS IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA/PROMOUV More than half of residents in sub-Saharan Africa's largest cities, and a growing proportion of Africans overall, live in congested informal settlements (also called slums). Residents of Africa's urban informal settlements are at elevated risk for poor sexual and reproductive health and rights, unintended pregnancies, unsafe abortion, and sexual and gender-based violence.    Interventions focused on men and boys expand the scope for challenging gender norms and masculine ideals that impede sexual and reproductive health and rights and sustain gender inequality in these communities. While implementers of male-targeted sexual and reproductive health and rights programs in Africa argue that their work is grounded in current international evidence on what works to promote the engagement of men and boys in gender equality and improved sexual and reproductive health and rights, little systematic research exists on the implementation, effectiveness, and effects of these initiatives.   This project will generate and disseminate evidence on the implementation, effectiveness, and challenges of male-targeted sexual and reproductive health and rights and positive masculinity initiatives in poor urban settlements. It will assess gender attitudes, norms, and practices as well as the sexual and reproductive health and rights behaviours of men and boys participating in these programs. It will support existing male-targeted sexual and reproductive health and rights  initiatives to use evidence for program improvement. It will also document attitudes and changes in gender norms. Finally, it will strengthen the capacity of project team members and others and foster strategic alliances and partnerships with critical stakeholders, including policymakers and implementers, to ensure the more effective delivery of male-targeted sexual and reproductive health and rights programs./Plus de la moitié des habitants des plus grandes villes d'Afrique subsaharienne, et une proportion croissante d'Africains en général, vivent dans des établissements informels congestionnés (également appelés bidonvilles). Les résidents des établissements informels urbains d'Afrique courent un risque élevé d'avoir des problèmes de santé sexuelle et reproductive et de droits sexuels, de grossesses non désirées, d'avortements pratiqués dans des conditions dangereuses et de violence sexuelle et sexospécifique.    Les interventions axées sur les hommes et les garçons élargissent les possibilités de la remise en question des normes sexospécifiques et des idéaux masculins qui entravent la santé sexuelle et reproductive et les droits sexuels, et maintiennent l'inégalité entre les sexes dans ces communautés. Alors que les responsables de la mise en œuvre des programmes de santé sexuelle et reproductive et de droits sexuels axés sur les hommes en Afrique soutiennent que leur travail s'appuie sur des données probantes internationales actuelles sur les facteurs permettant de promouvoir la participation des hommes et des garçons à l'égalité des sexes, ainsi que l'amélioration de la santé sexuelle et reproductive et les droits sexuels, on trouve peu de recherches systématiques sur la mise en œuvre, l'efficacité et les effets de ces initiatives.   Ce projet produira et diffusera des données probantes concernant la mise en œuvre, l'efficacité et les défis de la santé sexuelle et reproductive, des droits sexuels axés sur les hommes et des initiatives de masculinité positive dans les établissements urbains pauvres.

The sectors mentioned include Health, Nutrition, Shelter and settlements, WASH (Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene), indicating a broad range of interventions.

The presence of the term 'Shelter and settlements' is key here as it suggests involvement with housing-related activities. However, there's no explicit mention of specific types of housing such as transitional shelters or temporary housing. The broader context includes responding to crisis situations which might imply an emergency or temporary nature to shelter provision.

Given this information:
- The 'Housing' class could apply because the project involves shelter and settlements, aligning with aspects like providing shelter in emergencies.
- The 'Transitional' class is also relevant since crisis response often involves emergency shelters or temporary supportive housing solutions for affected populations.

The text doesn't explicitly mention any classes such as homelessness, transitional shelters, incremental housing upgrades, social or market-oriented housing initiatives, or distinctly urban or rural activities. However, it does imply a focus on providing secure shelter (or containment) following an environmental disaster, which is related to the provision of safety and potentially improved living conditions in an emergency context.

EBRD CONTRIBUTION TO THE CHERNOBYL SHELTER FUND EBRD Beitrag zum Tschernobyl Shelter Fund,23510,"The title and description provided refer to a contribution by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) towards the Chernobyl Shelter Fund. The main focus is on the 'Shelter Fund,' which suggests an emphasis on providing or improving shelters, likely as part of efforts following the nuclear disaster in Chernobyl. Given that this involves emergency or long-term support structures, it can potentially fall under multiple categories.

1. **Housing**: The use of the term 'Shelter' implies a focus on housing solutions or improvements. If these are intended to improve living conditions for displaced persons due to the nuclear accident, this would align with the definition of providing shelter in emergencies and improving inadequate housing situations.

2. **Transitional**: Since the context involves Chernobyl, which has been associated with long-term displacement post-nuclear disaster, shelters here might be more than temporary but also not permanent homes. This could suggest a transitional phase, such as emergency shelters or other types of support structures that serve people over an extended period.

3. **Urban**: The Chernobyl area is specific and identifiable geographically, although the focus on 'shelter' doesn't directly indicate urban development; knowing the context helps link it to an urban setting affected by a disaster.
