Related issues (Comic Relief): Lack of voice, influence, agency. Summary: Freetowns slums are amongst the most difficult places to survive let alone thrive - on earth. Faced with enormous challenges in providing shelter and services of any kind, there are many projects which attempt to improve living conditions. But they do so with little co-ordination or useful information on exactly the scale and extent of the problems. Through a new organisation linked to the University, this project will train and support people to bring existing and new information together on Freetowns slums with the aim of contributing to Freetowns first urban development plan. This could significant improve the quality and coordination of services in the slums, leading to slums dwellers being more secure, safe and better off.

Women are often seen as the property of men, are taught to be submissive from a young age and are economically dependent. In Freetowns slums Sexual and Gender Based Violence (SGBV) including Female Genital Cutting (FGC), sexual exploitation and harassment, rape, unsafe sexual practices and commercial sex work are common occurrences.

The population is young with an average life expectancy of 48. There are high levels of gender inequality and gender based violence. The vast majority of young girls do not complete their schooling, there are high levels of teenage pregnancy and maternal mortality is the third highest worldwide. The project aims to improve the quality of life of people living in 10 slums in Freetown. Activities will be implemented to improve the sexual and reproductive health (SRH) of young people, particularly young women, and to support youth to develop sustainable livelihoods through training and access to micro-finance loans and loans for enterprise development. An emphasis will be placed on working collaboratively with local and national government as well as with other non-governmental agencies working in Freetown slums. As a result of the project SRH is expected to improve, livelihoods opportunities will be created and household incomes will be increased.

In the capital city Kampala it is estimated that more than 1.5 million people now live in slums, mostly located in overcrowded, flood-prone areas of the city. While the new Kampala Capital City Authority is taking steps to develop a more structured approach to this rapid urban growth, it has limited knowledge or detailed information on the 50 or more different slums in the city. At the same time, slum dwellers in Kampala continue to voice frustration at the lack of opportunities to engage with government and help shape the communities in which they live. This project will help Kampalas slum dwellers to organise themselves so that they can meaningfully participate in urban governance and development. Access to small loans and training will build livelihood opportunities and encourage saving and active citizenship. Data collected by slum dwellers will enable effective planning for upgrading informal settlements in partnership with government, while loan funds for improvements to basic services such as water and sanitation will begin to have a transformative effect on the living conditions for slum dwellers across all of Kampalas five districts.

Related issues (Comic Relief): Water and sanitation. Summary: As many as two million people live in informal settlements in Kampala, with the slums of Central, Nakawa, and Kawempe Divisions regarded as the most vulnerable in terms of flood risk and levels of poverty. Although access to clean water and public latrines has been improving in some areas through government and NGO efforts, the majority of residents still lack access to decent affordable water supply and sanitation services. Three in every four illnesses are water borne or preventable, accounting for 17% of deaths in children under-five. Many schools lack even basic facilities let alone separate latrines allowing privacy and appropriate segregation for girls and boys. Building on a project already underway with funding from Comic Relief in Kawempe, WaterAid now plans to replicate this work in Central and Nakawa Divisions. The extension project will see construction of water catchment tanks and separate latrine facilities in 30 schools, benefiting a total of 24,000 children, especially girls. At the same time, public information and training programmes will increase hygiene understanding amongst school children and wider communities, promote the construction of household latrines and give a voice to slum dwellers as they hold local authorities to account and work to further improve living conditions. An extension of the current project for two more years in Kawempe will help ensure a legacy of improved health, living conditions and water and sanitation services across slums in three Divisions of Kampala.

Many of these latrines are full because they cannot easily be emptied or relocated. When annual flooding occurs pits overflow leading to highly unsanitary conditions and a high incidence of disease and illness. This project has identified an innovative approach to faecal sludge management which addresses critical barriers in the sanitation chain the capture, transport, treatment and potential re-use of waste from pit latrines in a safe and sustainable way. As part of this pilot project, teams of pit latrine emptiers will be trained to ensure that waste is being safely transported and treated and awareness raising campaigns will take place in the communities to ensure there is an uptake of these improved services. The proposed project will seek to scale up the outreach and efficiency of the service being provided, further develop and test the way in which the service can be delivered better, and establish a basis for larger scale replication across informal settlements in Lusaka and other cities. This is an ambitious but exciting project which provides an opportunity to support the development and delivery of an important and basic service that could impact on many thousands of households living in Lusakas peri urban settlements.

Many of these latrines are full because they cannot easily be emptied or relocated. When annual flooding occurs pits overflow leading to highly unsanitary conditions and a high incidence of disease and illness. This project has identified an innovative approach to faecal sludge management which addresses critical barriers in the sanitation chain the capture, transport, treatment and potential re-use of waste from pit latrines in a safe and sustainable way. As part of this pilot project, teams of pit latrine emptiers will be trained to ensure that waste is being safely transported and treated and awareness raising campaigns will take place in the communities to ensure there is an uptake of these improved services. The proposed project will seek to scale up the outreach and efficiency of the service being provided, further develop and test the way in which the service can be delivered better, and establish a basis for larger scale replication across informal settlements in Lusaka and other cities. This is an ambitious but exciting project which provides an opportunity to support the development and delivery of an important and basic service that could impact on many thousands of households living in Lusakas peri urban settlements. Learning from the project could also have relevance for interventions in other cities.

Related issues (Comic Relief): Water and sanitation. Summary: For years South Africa has struggled with a legacy of totally inadequate housing for the majority of the population. In 2012 the City of Cape Town built 7,000 new houses, but has an official waiting list of 400,000 families. Many of these people live in informal settlements where hundreds queue for water and toilets, there is little work or education, the majority of people may have HIV/AIDS and violence is endemic. Over the last six years an innovative urban planning project has been developed, placing people at the heart of upgrading their own communities and reducing crime at the same time. The approach encourages the people to make decisions on how community space is used and what services are needed, while also providing stimulus through education, sport and employment. The people themselves retain control of the improvements. Working with City officials, this project will now be rolled out into three new informal settlements with especially challenging histories of violence and deprivation. By integrating basic services like water and toilets with early childhood education, legal aid services (particularly for women), business start-up training and much more, the project will lead to long term gains and a model which can be replicated elsewhere.

Related issues (Comic Relief): Land rights. Summary: Uganda is one of Africas most rapidly urbanizing countries, with as many as 3.5 million people living in slums today and estimated to reach 8 million by 2020. In Kampala, the new City Authority has published a proposed plan which could see the clearance and relocation of thousands of people from their homes in the slums, although proposals as to where they will move are far less clear. The need for sustainable housing solutions in Kampala becomes more critical by the month and many organisations continue to respond in different ways. But coordination and collaboration among stakeholders is poor, and there are currently few opportunities for organisations to share information or to develop collective responses to issues such as the need for eviction guidelines that protect the rights of slum dwellers and provide appropriate options for resettlement. This project will address these issues in two ways. First, it will help slum dwellers to establish housing cooperatives that will give them a stronger voice and improve access to land. Secondly, it will support development of an effective network for organisations working to improve the urban and slum environments, increasing access to key information and creating opportunities to participate in policy formation.

Summary: Up to 90% of women in Zambia experience intimate partner violence and a high proportion of those living in informal settlements in Lusaka. Many are unemployed, engage in transactional sex and regularly experience violence as a result. This project will create spaces where women can share their experiences, get counselling, and understand their rights. Working with social services, the police and others will strengthen womens access to justice. Some women will also receive support to help them create small businesses. It will also work with younger men and as part of an existing campaign encouraging them to reject violence against women and become positive role models themselves.

Related issues (Comic Relief): Sexual abuse or exploitation. Summary: It is estimated that around 20,000 young girls under the age of 18 are currently engaged in commercial sex work in Kampalas slums. Some are as young as 13. In many cases the girls have been trafficked from rural areas. Others end up in the trade as they see no other way of earning a living. The consequences are dire: high rates of HIV/AIDS, illegal abortions leading to increased mortality, substance abuse, mental health disorders and exposure to violence at the hands of clients or the police. Based on the learning from a successful and inspiring pilot project, this proposal will support girls and young women exploited in sex work to find ethical, meaningful and less risky alternatives to make a living. Through rehabilitation and vocational training, the project will help a total of 900 commercial sex workers develop the skills and confidence to find employment or start a business. Those who are mothers will receive extra support to take better care of their children. Access to integrated services will also improve sexual and reproductive health for around 25,000 particularly vulnerable slum dwellers. At the same time, initiatives will be taken to ensure both local communities and those in positions of authority understand the importance of protecting the rights of young women and girls forced into sex work and that appropriate laws and systems are in place to ensure that protection.

Related issues (Comic Relief): Water and sanitation. Summary: Freetown slums are in a deplorable state with many areas devoid of piped water and any form of improved sanitation. Most houses are made of temporary building materials and settlements are vulnerable to flooding. Cholera is a recurrent hazard. Comic Relief funded a previous slum project (2008 2012) supporting communities in three slums to improve their quality of life. However, the need to make additional improvements within these settlements and to help others, still exists. This follow-on project intends to support young people, petty traders (particularly women) and other disadvantaged people living in 8 slums in Freetown. The project will provide vocational training and apprenticeships, affordable micro-credit loans and improvement of literacy, business and money management skills. It will also improve access to basic services, including water and improved drainage and provide hygiene training. The capacity of local community based organisations (CBOs) will be strengthened and support provided to improve advocacy skills, enhancing their ability to hold government to account. As a result there will be a healthier environment and increased incomes, especially for women, young people and other marginalised groups, leading to a better quality of life in the slums. In addition the project will promote advocacy relating to streamlining of land tenure systems and seek to influence planning and national housing policy. The government of the UK (DfID) funded 50 percent of this grant - this share is excluded to avoid double counting in the DAC statistics. Full grant commitment: GBP 850 thousand.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3

Over centuries, Wuzhou has served as a gateway city and regional transportation center to connect Guangxi with national and international markets, particularly through river transportation. In line with the Government?s development program, Wuzhou will be developed into a multimode regional transportation hub through domestically funded ongoing transportation projects. However, geological and geographic conditions constrain urban development in Wuzhou. The city is in a mountainous region divided into three parts by two big rivers. Because flat urban land is lacking, the residents tended to build their houses in the marginal lands, which were gradually expanding up the mountains along slopes of major valleys. The mountains in Wuzhou are mainly formed by loose earth, eroded granite, and clastic rocks. As such, they are vulnerable to rain-triggered geological disasters (known as geohazards) in the form of landslides, slope collapse, and mud and debris flows. Many of these valleys, though densely populated, have been classified as geohazard-prone zones.With support from the central Government, the Wuzhou municipal government (WMG) has made enormous investments to strengthen the control of geological disasters, mainly by building and rehabilitating of the slope protections and retaining walls. However, such traditional control measures have not always been economical and optimal solutions. Under severe weather conditions, these slope protections and retaining walls can be washed away together with houses and other buildings.The Guangxi Wuzhou Urban Development Project will adopt a new approach to address the geohazard concern of the city. The basic principle of this new approach to geohazard management is a shift from disaster rehabilitation to prevention. Under the Project, geological disasters are to be prevented through holistic urban planning and integrated public investment. The combination of these efforts will result in (i) carefully designed urban planning for long-term urban expansion, (ii) relocation of the people living in the geohazard-prone valley to the newly developed geohazard-free urban area, (iii) engineering measures for geohazard control to convert the evacuated geohazard-prone valley into geohazard-free land for urban redevelopment, and (iv) stronger geohazard forecasting and early warning capability to improve the effectiveness of the city?s geohazard management system.The Project is aimed at promoting sustainable urban development and improving quality of life in Wuzhou. The outcomes of the Project include improved environmental management through the enhanced disaster management and infrastructure and improved municipal services, particularly in the areas of wastewater management and solid waste management.",,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,3

It will leverage private sector investment to (i) deliver 10,000 affordable green housing units, and (ii) redevelop 100 hectares of ger areas into eco-districts. The project is aligned with the following impacts: living conditions in Mongolia improved, and Ulaanbaatar is a safe, healthy, and green city that is resilient to climate change, and provides a livable environment for its residents. The project will have the following outcome: access to low-carbon and climate-resilient eco-districts and green affordable housing in Ulaanbaatar ger areas increased. The project is consistent with ADB's country partnership strategy for Mongolia, 2017-?2020, and with the core themes of green, competitive, and inclusive cities of ADB?s Urban Operational Plan.The project will have three outputs: (i) resilient urban infrastructure, public facilities, and social housing units in ger areas constructed (public sector component),  (ii) long-term financing to developers for low-carbon affordable housing, market rate housing, and economic facilities in ger areas and to households for green mortgages increased (financial intermediation loan [FIL] component), and (iii) sector policy reforms implemented and capacity strengthened. Output 1 will deliver (i) green social housing units with climate adaptation and mitigation features, and (ii) resilient infrastructure, public space, and public facilities. Under output 2, up to $75.7 million of the GCF loan will be made available under the proposed FIL to enable an eco-district and affordable housing fund (EDAF) to provide long-term debt financing (denominated in local currency) to eligible commercial banks to support real estate developers? participation in the low-carbon housing market, and produce affordable green mortgages. Output 3 will support (i) project implementation, (ii) eco-district feasibility and development, policy improvement on climate change adaptation and mitigation, and improved supply and access to affordable green housing units, (iii) detailed design and supervision, and (iv) sustainable green housing finance.Eco-district parameters. The project eco-districts will be low-carbon, climate-resilient, mixed-income, and mixed-use areas with approximately 30% public space. The project?s five phases will deliver about 20 eco-districts or subprojects, with each covering an average of 5 ha. Phase 1 include two core subprojects (10 ha) in Bayankhoshuu and Selbe subcenters, phases 2?3 will have 8 subprojects (40 ha), and phases 4?5 will have 10 subprojects (50 ha).

It will leverage private sector investment to (i) deliver 10,000 affordable green housing units, and (ii) redevelop 100 hectares of ger areas into eco-districts. The project is aligned with the following impacts: living conditions in Mongolia improved, and Ulaanbaatar is a safe, healthy, and green city that is resilient to climate change, and provides a livable environment for its residents. The project will have the following outcome: access to low-carbon and climate-resilient eco-districts and green affordable housing in Ulaanbaatar ger areas increased. The project is consistent with ADB's country partnership strategy for Mongolia, 2017-?2020, and with the core themes of green, competitive, and inclusive cities of ADB?s Urban Operational Plan.The project will have three outputs: (i) resilient urban infrastructure, public facilities, and social housing units in ger areas constructed (public sector component),  (ii) long-term financing to developers for low-carbon affordable housing, market rate housing, and economic facilities in ger areas and to households for green mortgages increased (financial intermediation loan [FIL] component), and (iii) sector policy reforms implemented and capacity strengthened. Output 1 will deliver (i) green social housing units with climate adaptation and mitigation features, and (ii) resilient infrastructure, public space, and public facilities. Under output 2, up to $75.7 million of the GCF loan will be made available under the proposed FIL to enable an eco-district and affordable housing fund (EDAF) to provide long-term debt financing (denominated in local currency) to eligible commercial banks to support real estate developers? participation in the low-carbon housing market, and produce affordable green mortgages. Output 3 will support (i) project implementation, (ii) eco-district feasibility and development, policy improvement on climate change adaptation and mitigation, and improved supply and access to affordable green housing units, (iii) detailed design and supervision, and (iv) sustainable green housing finance.Eco-district parameters. The project eco-districts will be low-carbon, climate-resilient, mixed-income, and mixed-use areas with approximately 30% public space. The project?s five phases will deliver about 20 eco-districts or subprojects, with each covering an average of 5 ha. Phase 1 include two core subprojects (10 ha) in Bayankhoshuu and Selbe subcenters, phases 2?3 will have 8 subprojects (40 ha), and phases 4?5 will have 10 subprojects (50 ha). Each subproject should be completed within 5 years.  Phases 2?5 will identify and prepare a batch of subprojects to be appraised based on eligibility and selection criteria, including financial and physical parameters, formulated from the feasibility study of the two core subprojects.  A detailed infrastructure and architectural design produced for each subproject will ensure (i) adequate ratio for social (15%), affordable (55%), and market rate (30%) housing units, (ii) balance between public space and amenities, commercial areas, and residential units, and (iii) financial viability and rentability to allow private sector participation. The redevelopment process and housing construction will be undertaken onsite, and will be demand-driven.Sector lending with financial intermediation loan component modality. The sector lending modality was deemed the most appropriate modality to achieve the project objectives because (i) a large number of subprojects in the sector are to be financed, (ii) the government and MUB have sector development plans (SDPs) to ensure the priority development needs of the cross sectoral policy improvement plan are met, and to guide project implementation, (iii) sect",17,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,3

Sida has made an assessment and proposes a 4-year long support (2019-2022), amounting to 275 million SEK. The overarching objective of the intervention is to address the extensive global deficit of affordable and adequate housing and access to basic services such as water and sanitation for people living in poverty. More than one billion people live in informal settlements with substandard access to water and sanitation. By producing affordable houses, the intervention intends to demonstrate that perceived and real obstacles to a functioning sector for affordable housing can be overcome. The intention is that this will attract international and local banks as well as professional building companies and thus catalyse a wider effect. The houses are to be designed to addresses identified blockages to a functioning market for affordable houses and/or bread new grounds in relation to target group, design solutions, financing solutions or other identified needs to systematically address the housing shortage. Dissemination of results and active advocacy efforts to achieve policy development and sustainable financing solutions is to be done continuously. The production of the houses is done by local organisations that are part of Reall s network, through which they receive capacity development support and financing. The local organisations are supported to be able to design and build well planned, affordable and environmentally sustainable houses with a high level of target group participation. Because of lack of other end-user finance alternatives, most of the network organisations provides this service for the target group. Central aspects of the intervention are, -to prove that poor people can and want to finance their own home when the right conditions exist and-to demonstrate that solid work with transparency and a very high level of internal governance and control can make construction processes predictable and reduce the risk of corruption.These two areas are crucial to attract both financiers and other players to the market for low-cost housing.Reall is a non-profit organization based in the UK that supports a network of local organizations. Upon successful assessments, Reall forwards grants to these organisations for functional costs and soft loans for them to build qualitative housing for people with an income between 10-40% on their respective country s income pyramid. The network has presently members in Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Angola, Philippines, Nepal, Pakistan, India, Burkina Faso, Ghana, South Africa, Malawi, Nigeria and Mozambique.Concrete results expected to be generated include 4,000 new adequate and affordable homes, of which an increasing proportion are owned by women or jointly by a man and a woman, as well as an increasing degree of houses adapted",6.2;6.1;11.c;11.7;11.3;11.1,1,1,1,1,0,,1,0,0,1,0,0.0,0.0,3

The overarching objective of the intervention is to address the extensive global deficit of affordable and adequate housing and access to basic services such as water and sanitation for people living in poverty.

The five perspectives are integrated in We Effects operations and contribute to change within them. The poverty perspective, the rights based approach and the gender equality perspectives characterize the operations and programs to a great extent. These perspectives are part of the vision, objectives, working methods, strategies and methods. The organization shows a high level of ambition with regard to the environmental and climate perspective. A majority of the programs include climate and environment in the objectives and We Effect have methods and tools for eg environmental assessment.

To achieve the overall goal and results, the ALCANCE programme will focus its activities in three provinces located in the northern part of Mozambique namely: Nampula, Niassa and Cabo Delgado. We Effect will use its Lichinga Office in Niassa, as the main hub for the overall programme coordination. Sida assesses that the target provinces are well aligned with the increased geographic focus of the Swedish operationalisation plan. We Effect has been implementing several programmes related to Swedish Development cooperation in Mozambique since 1991, with its first field office in the northern province of Niassa on which implemented interventions such as the Programa de Apoio a Sociedade Civil -PASC (contribution ID 23000249) and the Agricultura e Recursos Naturais - ARENA (contribution ID 51140056).  The major bilateral partnership with the Swedish Embassy was through the Actions for an Inclusive and Accountable Governance (AGIR II) programme, 2010-2020 with its sub-programme entitled Natural Resources, Agriculture, Climate Change, and Environment (NACE). For the implementation of NACE, We Effect managed approximately 176 million Swedish Krona. In 2020 as AGIR II programme was being finalized, however an extension of the NACE sub-programme until December 2021 was agreed.The ALCANCE programme is proposed to be implemented in two phases. The  budget for the first phase of  two years amounts to a total amount of 75, 8 MSEK / 456, 44 MMZN (1 SEK = 6,017 MZN),  is presented on a cost-basis with 6 main headers: 66,7% for Funds transfers to partners equal to 50,6 MSEK (312,2 MMZN) and  33,3% equal to 25,2 MMSEK (144,2 MMZN) for We Effect lead activities,  Monitoring and evaluation, Programme staff costs, Programme support costs and Administration overhead. The Embassy assesses that the budget is reasonable in relation to the objectives and provides for a basis for a cost-efficient implementation of the programme.Since the cooperation partner will have a component of forwarding of funds to third partiesâ€™ trough different funding modalities, even though We Effect has systems for planning, monitoring, reporting, evaluation and learning in place, the Embassy's analysis is that both the recurring financial monitoring and operational monitoring of the partners need to be strengthened to ensure that Sida funding is applied properly to achieve the expected programme results.In conclusion,  Sida assesses that the impact of the ALCANCE contribution, lay the ground for an effective, equitable and systems, sustainable livelihoods, improved gender equality and resilient communities to climate change through empowering partner organizations to increase their access to productive land, access and better control of the means of productions as well as increasing the knowledge by women and smallholders farmers about the right to food of three target provinces, Niassa, Nampula and Cabo Delgado.",5.1;2.4;16.7;15.3;1.4,1,1,2,0,1,,0,0,0,1,0,0.0,0.896,1

The overarching objective of the intervention is to address the extensive global deficit of affordable and adequate housing and access to basic services such as water and sanitation for people living in poverty. More than one billion people live in informal settlements with substandard access to water and sanitation.

Sida has made an assessment and proposes a 4-year long support (2019-2022), amounting to 275 million SEK. The overarching objective of the intervention is to address the extensive global deficit of affordable and adequate housing and access to basic services such as water and sanitation for people living in poverty. More than one billion people live in informal settlements with substandard access to water and sanitation. By producing affordable houses, the intervention intends to demonstrate that perceived and real obstacles to a functioning sector for affordable housing can be overcome. The intention is that this will attract international and local banks as well as professional building companies and thus catalyse a wider effect. The houses are to be designed to addresses identified blockages to a functioning market for affordable houses and/or bread new grounds in relation to target group, design solutions, financing solutions or other identified needs to systematically address the housing shortage. Dissemination of results and active advocacy efforts to achieve policy development and sustainable financing solutions is to be done continuously. The production of the houses is done by local organisations that are part of Reall s network, through which they receive capacity development support and financing. The local organisations are supported to be able to design and build well planned, affordable and environmentally sustainable houses with a high level of target group participation. Because of lack of other end-user finance alternatives, most of the network organisations provides this service for the target group. Central aspects of the intervention are, -to prove that poor people can and want to finance their own home when the right conditions exist and-to demonstrate that solid work with transparency and a very high level of internal governance and control can make construction processes predictable and reduce the risk of corruption.These two areas are crucial to attract both financiers and other players to the market for low-cost housing.Reall is a non-profit organization based in the UK that supports a network of local organizations. Upon successful assessments, Reall forwards grants to these organisations for functional costs and soft loans for them to build qualitative housing for people with an income between 10-40% on their respective country s income pyramid. The network has presently members in Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Angola, Philippines, Nepal, Pakistan, India, Burkina Faso, Ghana, South Africa, Malawi, Nigeria and Mozambique.Concrete results expected to be generated include 4,000 new adequate and affordable homes, of which an increasing proportion are owned by women or jointly by a man and a woman, as well as an increasing degree of houses adapted",6.2;6.1;11.c;11.7;11.3;11.1,1,1,1,1,0,,1,0,0,1,0,0.0,0.0,3

The overarching objective of the intervention is to address the extensive global deficit of affordable and adequate housing and access to basic services such as water and sanitation for people living in poverty. More than one billion people live in informal settlements with substandard access to water and sanitation.

The production of the houses is done by local organisations that are part of Reall's network, through which they receive capacity development support and financing. The local organisations are supported to be able to design and build well planned, affordable and environmentally sustainable houses with a high level of target group participation. Because of lack of other end-user finance alternatives, most of the network organisations provides this service for the target group. Central aspects of the intervention are, -to prove that poor people can and want to finance their own home when the right conditions exist and-to demonstrate that solid work with transparency and a very high level of internal governance and control can make construction processes predictable and reduce the risk of corruption.These two areas are crucial to attract both financiers and other players to the market for low-cost housing.Reall is a non-profit organization based in the UK that supports a network of local organizations. Upon successful assessments, Reall forwards grants to these organisations for functional costs and soft loans for them to build qualitative housing for people with an income between 10-40% on their respective country's income pyramid. The network has presently members in Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Angola, Philippines, Nepal, Pakistan, India, Burkina Faso, Ghana, South Africa, Malawi, Nigeria and Mozambique.Concrete results expected to be generated include 4,000 new adequate and affordable homes, of which an increasing proportion are owned by women or jointly by a man and a woman, as well as an increasing degree of houses adapted for residents with functional variations. The houses are intended to directly contribute to an improved standard of living for 20,000 people. As a side effect of improved infrastructure to these settings, another 2000 households will have access to safe water and / or sanitation.",6.2;6.1;11.c;11.7;11.3;11.1,1,1,1,1,0,,1,0,0,1,0,0.0,0.0,3

Med najbolj prizadetimi so družine, ki jih sestavljajo otroci-sirote, ki živijo v zasilnih šotorih, ki ne varujejo pred vremenskimi vplivi, pogosto zbolijo ter so ve?inoma podhranjeni.Cilj projekta je, da se z naselitvijo v varnih hišah otrokom zagotovi splošna varnost, varovanje pred kriminalom, izboljša fizi?no in psihi?no zdravje. Poleg tega projekt ima za cilj tudi zmanjšanje hude revš?ine in odpravljanje lakote preko vzpostavljanja sistema zagotavljanja dolgotrajne prehranske varnosti otrok. Dolgoro?en cilj projekta je omogo?iti otrokom, da bi lahko obiskovali šolo. Z boljšo izobrazbo se jim bodo pove?ale zaposlitvene možnosti in tako se bo na dolgi rok zmanjšala revš?ina.    Projekt predvideva, da bo v obdobju dveh let zgrajenih 108 hiš s pripadajo?im zemljiš?em. Poleg tega bo v okviru projekta 108 družin prejelo kmetijski paket (s pripadajo?im usposabljanjem in izobraževanjem o kmetovanju) in 432 otrok bo prejelo paket šolskih potrebš?in.Celotna vrednost projekta znaša 60.000 EUR.",,0,0,0,,,,,0,0,0,,,,3

This project plans to provide entrepreneurship and business development training for trainees to utilize acquired skills and succeed in their livelihood improvement. ISSB market survey conducted in the first year showed that there are potential needs for ISSB, but it is not yet known in the area, thus it is essential to put more efforts on ISSB marketing activities. In the 2nd year, firstly, ISSB marketing activities will be enhanced. Secondly, ISSB youth groups will be given the contract of ISSB classrooms and perimeter wall construction. Thirdly, mainly by business development facilitators trained in the first year,  entrepreneurship and business development support system  will be strengthened based on Business Support Center. Trainings and continuous support for the ISSB trainees and other youth groups with qualified skills or business ideas will also be provided.",8;11,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0.2737,8

Through a comparative analysis of existing affordable housing models and assessing their sustainability performance, this research proposes to develop a framework for implementing the most sustainable, affordable South African housing model using innovative technologies. The rationale for this research stems from the views held by scholars that the perpetual challenge of providing adequate, affordable housing cannot be solved by traditional methods and techniques. The housing backlog in South Africa is currently estimated at 2.3 million and has been projected to increase as a result of low production rate due to the overt reliance on conventional technologies. The focus to date within the affordable housing domain has been significantly economical, hence not embedding the elemental dynamics of sustainability which is increasingly becoming of great concern, especially the social and environmental components. Therefore, research is needed on the full life-cycle economic, environmental and social impacts on affordable housing, emphasising how to optimise the effects by employing innovative technologies. The study will undertake a systematic literature review to identify the indicators and suitable innovative technologies for enabling sustainable affordable housing. In furtherance to this, it will adopt a mixed-method research methodology involving a juxtaposition of expert interviews and survey of participants to selected affordable housing developments in South Africa. The research data collected will be analysed using analytical techniques to determine sustainability index of conventional methods and innovative technologies and develop a sustainable, affordable housing model for South Africa. It is expected that the study's findings will reveal the potential of innovative technologies to address the challenges encountered in the development of sustainable, affordable housing models within the South African context with opportunities for operationalization in similar developing country contexts.",11.1,0,,,,0,0,0,0,,,,,0.0199,1

This construction industry is also known for its poor productivity. Colombia, in particular, has one of the lowest indexes of productivity and at the same time shows a negative growth.This project will contribute to the solution of a particular challenge in the Colombian construction sector, that of optimizing concrete construction for social housing applications. By partnering with a larger research project with similar goals (ACORN), and by involving local industry, this project will advance the state-of-the-art in concrete construction, and build a network of stakeholders working towards sustainability and economic benefits. This partnership represents a true win-win opportunity, with the Colombian context benefitting from the findings of a larger research project, and the UK researchers getting the opportunity to see how their scientific findings can be transferred to a very different social, cultural and economic context.The project has three stages, each with a specific objective. Following an in depth understanding of the ACORN team's approach and findings to-date, the first stage will include interviews with policy makers and industry leaders, to define a specific opportunity to apply the findings in a Colombian social housing context. The second stage will develop the case study by analysing hybrid (not fully-automated) design-to-production possibilities, compatible with the Colombian industrial capabilities, producing a prototype. This will evaluate not only the structural behaviour, but also the sustainability performance and economic viability in comparison to standard practice. The third stage will be dedicated to dissemination of the developed design, testing the viability of its application with stakeholders and defining paths to continue its development.",11.1,0,,,,0,0,0,0,,,,,0.0026,1

Severe droughts, prolonged heatwaves and continent-wide wildfires were experienced in Americas, Australia, Asia and Africa. The worst impacts were produced by floods across the world. UK was no exception as Storm Franklin wreaked havoc across the country in February followed by sporadic heavy floodings throughout the year. Floods caused landslides and mudslides in Africa and South America. Asia was the worst affected by floods with the deadliest experiences in Pakistan. At one point one-third of the country was underwater with over 33 million people displaced.Beyond the statistics, the situation reveals a particularly fragile state for communities around the world irrespective of the North-South divide. One of the biggest impacts of natural disasters has been on housing. The pandemic experience has already implied the need for quality housing for sustainable and healthy living. In its 2022 report the UK's Regulator of Social Housing has warned of risks and challenges to the affordable housing. In a global context, the housing situation emerges as a wicked problem of development. Unlike tame problems that can be clearly stated, written-down, agreed-upon and solved, wicked problems are difficult to define, contradictory in nature, and tricky to solve since every effort to find a solution leads to another set of challenges. There are many unknown unknowns.Res-House extends the SPRET Network (Frontiers Champions Tranche 2 Grant) that produced an invaluable repository of sustainable zero-energy housing design. The network will be extended to accommodate resilience framework in fragile settings and seek smart, affordable, and sustainable housing solutions. Working at community level adaptation and resilience will allow understanding local needs, empowering communities, and exploring suitable designs, local materials and traditional methods for decent housing respecting the individual and community wellbeing.",11.1,0,,,,0,0,0,0,,,,,0.0124,1

Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy sharing is an innovative method to enhance local energy generation and demand balance, and reduce the rural community's reliance on power grid. The P2P energy sharing will provide the additional capacity required for the newly township development, and reduce energy costs for local communities. In order to facilitate the local rural urbanisation and support the business development, our planned research activities include: 1) energy and power demand modelling for new land developments, 2) microgrid and networked microgrid development considering P2P energy sharing, 3) control algorithms for P2P energy sharing to enhance local energy sufficiency and reduce energy costs for consumers, and 4) modern power electronic development to support P2P energy sharing, and energy management of energy storage systems.Modelling and control algorithm design for energy infrastructure using P2P energy sharing method will be carried out considering a vacant land in North West of Pretoria as a case study. For this collaboration, the partners include Dr. Ye from University of Pretoria who is specialised in energy modelling and optimisation for both demand side management and renewable energy integrations, Dr. Hu who is an expert for power electronic device of microgrids and electric vehicles, and Dr. Long whose expertise lies in the P2P energy sharing networks. The urgent energy infrastructure development needs are in line with the business scope of our industry partner Mr. Nyonganyi from Optimal Engineering Solutions in South Africa, and Mr. Stephen Parkinson from Entrust Microgrid in the UK. The responsibilities of the three university partners and two industry partners are well planned considering the roles and expertise to achieve the planned outcomes for teaching, research and innovation.",11.1,0,,,,0,0,0,0,,,,,0.0128,1

Además, son personas que pertenecen a las castas de los últimos escalafones del sistema de castas hindú, sistema abolido por la Constitución india de 1950, que todavía se encuentra muy arraigado en el ámbito rural donde viven las tres cuartas partes de la población del país, y en donde se desarrolla el proyecto.Las casas que construirán RDT/WDT y los beneficiarios y beneficiarías contarán con 4 espacios (2 estancias, un baño y un porche) y en los casos que sea necesario, una rampa que facilite la accesibilidad. Estarán hechas de cemento y ladrillos con una base elevada cubierta de láminas, para evitar la entrada de serpientes y escorpiones. Una vivienda de estas características está provista de las condiciones necesarias de salubridad, constituyendo un resguardo eficaz ante las inclemencias del clima, y proporcionando un ambiente familiar limpio y digno. Todo ello repercutirá en el desarrollo integral de la familia.Beneficiarios directos: La población beneficiaría directa son 28 personas discapacitadas, 10 mujeres y 18 hombres más sus familias, que con una media de 4 personas por familia son un total de 112 personas beneficiarías directas. Los terrenos de las viviendas se inscribirán a nombre de las personas con discapacidad de la familia como primer paso para promover su empoderamiento socio-económico.Las edades van desde los 15 hasta los 48 años, y por tipo de discapacidad, 11 tienen diferentes grados de discapacidad física, 5 discapacidad múltiple, 3 discapacidad intelectual, 5 personas son discapacitados/as auditivas y 4 son personas con discapacidad visual.Beneficiarios indirectos: Al ser un proyecto comunitario y no meramente puntual, los beneficiarios indirectos se extienden en general a las comunidades rurales implicadas, 22.025 personas, y en particular a los miembros de los shangams de personas con discapacidad de las aldeas (163 personas).",,0,0,1,0,,,,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0064,1

Queda justificada de manera concisa la necesidad  del proyecto, ya que, tal y como se describe en los antecedentes, la población del distrito de Anantapur está situada en la zona más seca del país, en ella residen en su mayoría campesinos sin tierra, cuya única fuente de ingresos proviene de la agricultura y concretamente, del cacahuete y  depende de los ciclos de lluvia. Los campesinos emigran a otras áreas para sobrevivir, desintegrando las familias, la comunidad, el abandono de la educación. Por otro lado, la falta de recursos provoca falta de alimentos y malnutrición.El objetivo último de la ONGD es el desarrollo comunitario, por ello la construcción de viviendas, evitará la migración de las personas de la aldea, haciéndoles partícipes de la comunidad al tener ya una propiedad. Siendo la mujer la responsable de ésta se  favorecerá su empoderamiento dentro de una sociedad donde el hombre tiene la última palabra. Con la construcción de las 49 viviendas con saneamiento, cuya titular será la mujer, se pretende frenar la emigración, creando núcleos estables y promoviendo así el tejido asociativo de la aldea. Con la creación de centros comunitarios podrán llevarse a cabo nuevos proyectos de desarrollo económico y social.Al incorporar saneamiento en las viviendas se evitarán enfermedades como el cólera, malaria, diarrea provocadas por la falta de higiene. El proyecto actuaría sobre dos problemas diferentes y complementarios, por un lado la falta de acceso al derecho a una vivienda digna y por otro al derecho del agua y saneamiento.Las personas beneficiarias directas del proyecto son 49 personas y sus familias de la comunidad de Venkatampalli, 47 mujeres y 2 hombres monoparentales. Viven bajo el umbral de la pobreza en zonas rurales y pertenecen a las castas más bajas de la estructura de la sociedad India. El proyecto se centra en las mujeres de las zonas rurales, de las 49 personas beneficiarias, 47 son mujeres, casadas en su mayoría menores de 38 años y 2 hombres viudos de 40 años de edad. Más de la mitad de las mujeres son analfabetas, cuya actividad económica principal son labores agrícolas.El proyecto beneficiará indirectamente a 342 personas habitantes de la aldea, que sobre todo se beneficiaran desde el punto de vista de la salud pública al reducirse la contaminación microbiológica sobre las fuentes de agua que implica la defecación al aire libre.

La India. :: El presente proyecto se desarrolla en la comunidad rural D. Cherlopalli (384 familias / 1.296 habitantes), Región de Bathalapalli, del distrito de Anantapur, en el estado de Andhra Pradesh (46,7 millones hab.), al sudeste del país. Desde el año 1996, la construcción de viviendas es uno de los sectores principales en los que interviene la Fundación Vicente Ferrer, entendiendo el derecho a la vivienda como un derecho universal. En este sentido, se han construido mas de 61.000 viviendas para la población rural de Anantapur. Además, con el presente proyecto se busca ir un paso más adelante y trabajar también en el derecho al saneamiento, por medio de la construcción de baños con letrinas adecuados a las necesidades de la población local, lo cual tendrá consecuencias muy importantes sobre la salud de la población, especialmente para los niños y las niñas, y la seguridad de las mujeres. Para ello se construirán 54 viviendas dignas en la comunidad rural de D. Cherlopalli, asegurando que la propiedad queda en manos de las mujeres cabeza de familia, con el fin de promover el empoderamiento social de las mismas.Las mujeres y sus familias viven ahora en chozas deterioradas, poco salubres e inseguras, que perpetúan su situación de vulnerabilidad y exclusión, especialmente de las mujeres, empeorada por la inseguridad que conlleva la defecación e higiene personal al aire libre.Este proyecto es el resultado del trabajo entre el Panchayat (gobierno local), el Comité de Desarrollo Comunitario (CDC), la población meta y la contraparte local. Para ello, atendiendo a la solicitud de la comunidad D. Cherlopalli, se plantea hacer efectivo su derecho a una vivienda digna, proporcionándoles los recursos humanos, técnicos y materiales necesarios para la construcción de viviendas, de forma que sus miembros participen en los trabajos de gestión y construcción en la medida de sus posibilidades. Con la realización de este proyecto, se habrá conseguido facilitar el acceso a una vivienda digna con saneamiento básico a 54 mujeres y sus familias (233 personas). Los resultados esperados y las actividades para alcanzarlos, son:RE1. Promovido el derecho a una vivienda digna, permanente y segura a 54 mujeres y sus familias en la comunidad rural de D. Cherlopalli: 1.1. Estudios y preparación de planos técnicos, preparación de terrenos y obtención de licencias. 1.2. Identificación de proveedores de materiales y suministros. 1.3.

En este sentido, se han construido más de 64.000 viviendas para la población rural de Anantapur. Además, con el presente proyecto se busca ir un paso más adelante y trabajar también en el derecho al saneamiento, por medio de la construcción de baños con letrinas adecuados a las necesidades de la población local, lo cual tendrá consecuencias muy importantes sobre la salud de la población, especialmente para los niños y las niñas, y la seguridad de las mujeres. Para ello se construirán 16 viviendas dignas en la comunidad rural de D. Cherlopalli,  asegurando que la propiedad quede en manos de las mujeres cabeza de familia, con el fin de promover el empoderamiento social de las mismas. Las mujeres y sus familias viven ahora en chozas deterioradas, poco salubres e inseguras, que perpetúan su situación de vulnerabilidad y exclusión, especialmente de las mujeres, empeorada por la inseguridad que conlleva la defecación e higiene personal al aire libre. Este proyecto es el resultado del trabajo entre el Panchayat (gobierno local), el Comité de Desarrollo Comunitario (CDC), la población meta y la contraparte local. Para ello, atendiendo a la solicitud de las comunidad de Meerjapuram a través de sus representantes en el CDC, se plantea hacer efectivo su derecho a una vivienda digna, proporcionándoles los recursos humanos, técnicos y materiales necesarios para la construcción de viviendas, de forma que sus miembros participen en los trabajos de gestión y construcción en la medida de sus posibilidades. Con la realización de este proyecto, se habrá conseguido facilitar el acceso a una vivienda digna con saneamiento básico a las mujeres y personas con discapacidad y sus familias, a través de los siguientes resultados:R1. Habilitado el derecho de una vivienda digna y permanente a 66 personas  de los colectivos más desfavorecidos de la aldea de Meerjapuram  en condiciones óptimas de salubridadR2. Habilitado el acceso al derecho a un saneamiento básico a través de la construcción de 16 baños con pozo de filtraciónR3.

Algunos fueron alojando a sus parientes y amigos en casas que no estaban preparadas para ello, y otros muchos, aún hoy, permanecen sin un techo donde cobijarse. La situación de las familias sin hogar, viviendo de forma precaria, tras el terremoto del 12 de enero de 2010, se deterioró más si cabe, tras el paso de los huracanes Isaac (agosto 2012) y Sandy (Noviembre 2012). Arrasaron la mayor parte de las cosechas y deterioraron las condiciones de habitabilidad, golpeando de nuevo a la población, pero sobre todo a aquellas familias que continuaban viviendo en la calle. Estas familias padecen graves problemas y enfermedades, debido a sus malas condiciones de habitabilidad y saneamiento. La UCAD nos solicitó ayuda para la construcción de 80 viviendas para 80 familias que estaban en estas condiciones, priorizando a las mujeres viudas, con hijos a su cargo. Con ayudas recibidas de otras Instituciones públicas y privadas (Comunidad de Madrid, Ayuntamiento de Salamanca, el COAATM y Campaña de Acción Verapaz) hemos construido 59 casas. Solicitamos ahora la ayuda para las otras 21 familias. Necesitan y quieren un espacio donde vivir, y unas condiciones sanitarias dignas, para poder así reanudar las actividades que les permita iniciar una nueva vida.

El 60% de los pobres y el 83% de los indigentes viven en las áreas rurales (a pesar de que sólo constituyen la tercera parte de la población del país) y provienen mayoritariamente de poblaciones originarias de las etnias andinas y amazónicas. El problema identificado está relacionado con la precariedad de las viviendas de la población indígena. Las causas directas son las siguientes: 1. La autoconstrucción de las viviendas sin asistencia técnica que pone en riesgo la seguridad física y el confort de las personas generando mayor vulnerabilidad a riesgos geodinámicos, sismos y filtraciones de agua. 2.Las condiciones de insalubridad de las viviendas debido a las inadecuadas prácticas de higiene y limpieza asociadas al hacinamiento en el uso de los ambientes, la cohabitación de personas y animales menores, la escasa ventilación y asolamiento y los cambios bruscos de temperatura, que genera, sobre todo en niñas/os menores de 5 años, el incremento de infecciones respiratorias y digestivas, aumentando la desnutrición crónica infantil. 3.Los limitados ingresos económicos de las unidades familiares que impiden desarrollar inversiones para la mejora de las viviendas y pone en riesgo la seguridad alimentaria 4.Las limitadas capacidades en hombres y mujeres indígenas para generar propuestas en la demanda de vivienda digna ante las autoridades competentes. Con la implementación del proyecto se espera mejorar las condiciones de habitabilidad de las viviendas de la población indígena el desarrollo de sus capacidades y habilidades y la utilización tecnologías tradicionales mejoradas. Desde la tradicional organización comunal, se capacitará a las familias en la recuperación de prácticas ancestrales seguras, ecoeficientes y saludables con innovaciones sencillas que incorporen el uso de la energía solar, ventilación, servicios higiénicos y cocinas mejoradas. Asimismo, se apoyará a la familia (en particular a la mujer) en la instalación de infraestructura y equipamiento para la producción de cuyes separados de las personas lo que reducirá su mortalidad e incrementará la producción cárnica y reproductiva y los ingresos familiares que podrán ser destinados al mejoramiento en la vivienda. Finalmente, se promoverán espacios de concertación a través de distintos mecanismos institucionales de participación para generar y desarrollar acciones para la incidencia en las políticas públicas de acceso a una vivienda rural con dignidad. El enfoque estratégico de la intervención contempla diversos sistemas de capacitación para debatir y transferir habilidades e instrumentos para el mejoramiento de las condiciones de habitabilidad y salubridad de las familias de la Mancomunidad del Valle Sur de Cusco, y apuntará a disminuir las brechas de exclusión étnica cultural, socio económica y de género.",,2,1,2,,,,,0,0,1,0,0.0,0.0,3

El resultado fue viviendas sin vigas, pilares sin armadura o con armadura insuficiente, muros mal trabados.. y en consecuencia cuando se produjo el terremoto la mayoría de las casas colapsaron.

Para ello se plantea la construcción de 29 viviendas, haciendo efectivos los derechos de acceso a una vivienda y al saneamiento de 29 mujeres y sus familiares. Al mismo tiempo, se propone la mejora de los niveles de concienciación y conocimiento sobre el derecho al saneamiento, la higiene y las implicaciones de la defecación al aire libre, a través de la sensibilización de las familias beneficiarias y la población en general. El proyecto también trabaja para equilibrar las relaciones de género puesto que serán las mujeres las propietarias legales de las nuevas viviendas.  A través del acceso y el control de los recursos se espera contribuir a introducir cambios no sólo en las actitudes sino en los roles sociales de estos colectivos. En este sentido también se llevará a cabo un taller sobre Igualdad de Género dirigido a los maridos de las 29 destinarias del proyecto. La participación activa de las mujeres a lo largo de todas las actividades en paridad es también un factor clave para este objetivo. Se busca asimismo empoderar a las beneficiarias a partir de su participación en estructuras de organización comunitaria desde las que pueden reivindicar sus derechos y solicitar cambios para seguir mejorando sus vidas. La ejecución del proyecto se realiza en la Comunidad rural de Chinnamarriveedu. Esta comunidad rural se encuentra ubicada a 20km del área de Yemmiganur y a 55 de la región de Adoni, lo que garantiza un menor impacto ambiental a la hora de realizar el traslado de los materiales hasta la zona. La comunidad de Chinnamarriveedu cuenta con un total de 2.598 personas. Con este proyecto se pretende actuar sobre tres problemas complementarios: el elevado número de mujeres empobrecidas que viven en soluciones habitacionales precarias, la práctica de la defecación al aire libre y hábitos de higiene deficientes y, la vulneración de los derechos económicos que sufren las mujeres. Estos problemas se relacionan con la vulneración del derecho a la vivienda y del derecho al saneamiento, que afecta especialmente a la población perteneciente a los grupos más desfavorecidos del ámbito rural (dálits, castas bajas y grupos tribales) y de forma más aguda a las mujeres. Todas las casas son de tipo Hut, lo que comporta una estructura débil con materiales precarios que se ven altamente vulnerados en épocas de monzones o de condiciones climáticas adversas. A nivel general, considerando las viviendas en las que habitan ahora los beneficiarios y beneficiarias y sus familias, la mayoría sólo cuentan con una estancia, lo cual hace que las familias vivan hacinadas y sin intimidad entre sexos y unidades familiares, con suelos de tierra en muchos casos y techo de paja que no resguarda de las inclemencias climatológicas.",11.1,1,1,,0,0,0,0,0,,,1,0.0,0.0274,1

El sistema de castas aparece arraigado en la India, desde hace más de 2.500 años. Este sistema se halla integrado en todos los ámbitos de la sociedad, y clasifica a las personas en función de la etnia, casta o colectivo en el que hayan nacido. De este modo, las familias pertenecientes a colectivos considerados inferiores, como las castas bajas, o los dalits (?sin casta?), afrontan enormes dificultades que impiden su pleno desarrollo humano, económico y social. Entre las dificultades, y como resultado del rechazo que sufren estas personas, nos hallamos con que una parte de la población delpaís reside en alojamientos insalubres e inseguros. Circunstancia que no hace sino fomentar la espiral de pobreza que afecta a estas personas, perpetuando su vulnerabilidad y también su marginalidad.Para paliar esta problemática, el proyecto que se presenta se basa en la entrega de viviendas a 78 familias pertenecientes al colectivo sin casta o de castas bajas, de la comunidad rural de Palthur, ubicada en el distrito de Anantapur, al sur de la India. Con ello, se pretende garantizar el derecho de las familias beneficiarias de disponer una vivienda adecuada, y a residir en unas condiciones de habitabilidad que permitan su desarrollo personal, y su integración en la comunidad. En cuanto alámbito sanitario, la entrega de las viviendas supondrá una reducción sustancial del riesgo de sufrir enfermedades asociadas al hacinamiento, la insalubridad y la inseguridad. En este sentido, las nuevas viviendas que se plantea construir están provistas de las condiciones necesarias de salubridad, constituyendo un resguardo eficaz ante las inclemencias del clima, y proporcionando un ambientefamiliar limpio y digno. El proyecto también trabaja para equilibrar las relaciones de género. Las mujeres en India sufren una fuerte discriminación, intensificada por la pobreza y la casta. El proyecto promueve la participación activa de las mujeres en la paridad, fomentando que se conviertan en las titulares de los derechos a la tierra y la vivienda. A través del acceso y control de los recursos se pretende contribuir aintroducir cambios no solo en las actitudes, sino también en los roles sociales. Al mismo tiempo, se propone la mejora de los niveles de concienciación y conocimiento sobre el derecho al saneamiento, la higiene y las implicaciones de la defecación al aire libre, a través de la sensibilización de las familias beneficiarias y de la población de la comunidad rural de Palthur. El periodo de ejecución del proyecto está previsto que comprenda un total de 12 meses. El inicio de las actividades tendrá lugar en julio de 2023, cuando se proceda con la selección de los trabajadores que participar",11.1,0,1,,0,1,0,1,1,,,0,0.0,0.0216,1

No fue hasta 1996 que se creó oficialmente el Sector de Hábitat, en el que se inscribe la presente intervención. Se empezó construyendo unas 1.000 viviendas por año y se fue incrementando hasta llegar a las 5.000 viviendas anuales que se construyen en la actualidad, contabilizándose en la actualidad un total de 75.532 nuevos hogares, de las que 3.139 han sido construidas en el último año.  Con este proyecto se pretende actuar sobre dos problemas complementarios: el elevado número de familias empobrecidas que viven en soluciones habitacionales precarias y la práctica de la defecación al aire libre y hábitos de higiene deficientes en el marco de una emergencia sanitaria mundial debido a la pandemia por COVID-19. Estos dos problemas se relacionan con la vulneración del derecho a la vivienda y del derecho al saneamiento, que afecta especialmente a la población perteneciente a los grupos más desfavorecidos del ámbito rural (dalits, castas bajas y grupos tribales) y de forma más aguda a las mujeres y personas con discapacidad. Concretamente, con el presente proyecto se pretende reducir la vulnerabilidad social, económica y ambiental de 61 mujeres dalits y sus familias de la aldea rural de B.T.Project-(GMG), habilitando el derecho a la vivienda y al saneamiento, por medio de la construcción de viviendas con baños y letrinas adecuados a las necesidades de la población local, lo cual tendrá consecuencias muy importantes sobre la salud de la población, especialmente para los niños y las niñas, y la seguridad de las mujeres, y asegurando que la propiedad quede en manos de las mujeres cabeza de familia. También se realizarán talleres de sensibilización en higiene, para adaptarse a las nuevas infraestructuras de baños y letrinas, así como para aumentar la consciencia en la importancia de los buenos hábitos higiénicos y de salud, claves, aún más en el actual contexto de pandemia, para la prevención de enfermedades, incluido la COVID-19. El proyecto además promoverá el desarrollo y el empoderamiento en la capacidad de auto organización de las familias de la comunidad rural de B.T.Project-(GMG), mediante la creación del Comité de Construcción y las formaciones que recibirán, serán las propias familias beneficiarias las que realizarán una parte importe del proceso de compras de materiales y de monitorización de la construcción de las viviendas, lo que hará aumentar el sentimiento de apropiación del proyecto por su implicación en todas las fases del proyecto.Justificación puntuación:BENEFICIARIOS DIRECTOS: 61 familias vulnerables, esto es, un total de 287 personas, de las que 143 son mujeres y 144 son hombres y de las que 139 son menores: 74 niños y",11.1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0073,1

La comunidad de Siervas de San José cuenta con una comunidad en Iloilo, la capital de la isla de Iloilo, habiéndose seleccionado el municipio de Concepción por las posibilidades de coordinación y seguimiento del proyecto.

En enero de 2014 en el citado barrio se identifican, entre otras, estas necesidades: de las 149 familias, 118 de sus casas estaban totalmente dañadas, 38 de ellas con posibilidades de reconstruirse por sus propietarios, mientras que 80 familias cuentan con escasos recursos para hacerse cargo de su reconstrucción. Es un proyecto socio-comunitario basado en la solidaridad y ayuda mutua. Grupos de 5 familias, guiados por dos profesionales contratados, utilizando materias primas de la isla, construirán sus viviendas, agrupadas para facilitar la supervisión y optimizar el transporte de material.

En los últimos años los cambios producidos en las necesidades y forma de vida de la población local, están teniendo una repercusión muy importante sobre el hábitat tradicional, que está siendo abandonando en pro de viviendas ejecutadas con bloque de hormigón, situadas en las proximidades. Las carencias observadas en las nuevas construcciones están haciendo que la población vida bajo unas condiciones mínimas de confort, peores que las que les garantizan las viviendas construidas con técnicas tradicionales. Es por ello por lo que es necesario poner en valor los sistemas de construcción tradicional como garantía de un modelo de vida digno,aportando conocimiento sobre sus características técnicas y bioclimáticas. Además la pérdida de valores culturales de la población bereber, la emigración, la pérdida de oficios tradicionales, la transformación del modelo de hábitat y la desertización agravan el problema.

María de los Robles :: El Hogar de Apoyo Terapéutico Santa María de los Robles (HATSMR), está ubicado en el barrio Caracolí, al sur de la cuidad de Bogotá, en Colombia. Tuvo su origen en el año 2003, a partir de las visitas realizadas por Religiosas Esclavas del Sagrado Corazón de Jesús y el acompañamiento de personas voluntarias del barrio Caracolí, en Ciudad Bolívar en Bogotá ? Colombia, a familias con miembros con discapacidad (condición de discapacidad física, cognitiva, social y mental), de éste sector. En éstas visitas se detectaron las condiciones de vida de las familias, así como factores de vulnerabilidad: salud (falta de acceso al servicio médico), educación (analfabetismo), vivienda (hacinamiento, carencia de servicios públicos) y socio-culturales (desplazamiento, violencia, carencia de trabajo estable), a las que se veían expuestas. Se inició un trabajo encaminado a la búsqueda de estrategias para abordar algunas de estas problemáticas orientadas a las madres en su mayoría cabezas de hogar, por medio de talleres y capacitaciones. El Hogar de Apoyo se ha convertido en un espacio que ha ido ganando fuerza e influencia en la comunidad debido a su impacto y a la forma de generar desarrollo comunitario en las familias de las personas con discapacidad. Este año se espera atender un total de beneficiarios directos: 155 niños, 70 adultos, 82 familias, sin distinto geográfico, étnico, religioso, cultural. Contamos con un equipo de profesionales multidisciplinarios, que valoran las habilidades de cada uno y desde sus capacidades, orientan su desarrollo humano integral, a través de programas de capacitación y alfabetización para Madres, terapias integrales y multidisciplinarias, para los beneficiarios diversamente hábiles, ludoteca y taller de música para los niños/as del barrio Nuestra objetivo es seguir aumentando la cobertura de familias, lograr la alfabetización de las Madres (hay 6 madres cabeza de familia en el proyecto de alfabetización) lo cual es esencial como inicio para la preparación y capacitación hacia proyectos productivos según gustos, aptitudes y capacidades, permitirles acceder a una ingreso fijo y constante que mejore las condiciones de vida del núcleo familiar, de manera prioritaria, al integrante diversamente hábil, de las mismas, para darles una salida ocupacional y productiva.

Campamentos son los asentamientos donde ocho o más familias, que habitan viviendas agrupadas o contiguas, se encuentran en una situación irregular de tenencia del terreno y carecen de acceso regular a uno o más servicios básicos de la vivienda (agua potable, energía eléctrica y alcantarillado/fosa séptica). El proyecto final de carrera de Arquitectura, comienza con la investigación sobre este tema. Saber cómo se forman los campamentos, por qué actualmente hay gente viviendo en estas condiciones, cómo es su forma de vivir, qué problemas sociales tienen, ha sido información relevante para comenzar mi proyecto. Se continúa investigando el campamento Los Aromos, situado en Colina, a 14 km de distancia de Santiago de Chile. Comencé realizando un estudio urbano, para saber cuántas familias forman el campamento, quién es el propietario del terreno que están ocupando, si se encuentran en una zona de riesgo, y si se podría regularizar la situación. El resultado del proyecto, es una propuesta de viviendas sociales para mejorar la calidad de vida de 150 familias aproximadamente que ahora forman el campamento Los Aromos.",,1,1,0,,,,,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.003,1

Fortalecer las capacidades, tanto formativas como de equipamientos, del sistema comunitario de salud del Batey La Balsa en temas de salud comunitaria, prevención de violencia contra las mujeres y derechos sexuales y reproductivos. Para ello se llevarán a cabo sesiones de refuerzo con las 15 promotoras que conforman la Rede de Salud Comunitaria del Batey. Este refuerzo se ha diseñado conjuntamente con la Dirección Provincial de Salud y el Ministerio de la Mujer desde un enfoque de género con el objetivo de mejorar la calidad de vida de las mujeres y niñas del Batey para incidir en problemas de violencia en todas sus manifestaciones. Además, se complementará el equipamiento del Hogar Comunitaria y Salud y se trabajará con las mujeres del Batey en cuestiones relacionadas con la autoestima y los derechos sexuales y reproductivos. 3.

Concretamente el proyecto planteado se desarrollará en el Batey La Balsa, se pretende mejorar las condiciones de habitabilidad básica y de las condiciones de salud y de vida de las personas del Batey La Balsa, mediante la erradicación de los barracones y vivienda precaria y desarrollando acciones orientadas al fortalecimiento de la atención a la salud comunitaria y a una vida libre de violencia para las mujeres y niñas.El Instituto de Acción Comunitaria (IDAC) y ACPP, y más recientemente con el apoyo de AGARESO, plantean 3 ejes fundamentales de actuación consistentes en:1. Garantizar el acceso a una vivienda digna y saludable a 44 personas (27 son mujeres y 17 hombres) a través de la construcción y entrega a 8 familias de 4 bloques de viviendas adosadas (llamadas viviendas dúplex) con una fosa séptica con capacidad para 15 viviendas. Para el buen uso y mantenimiento de las mismas se constituirá y formará un Comité de Construcción que coordinará la mano de obra voluntaria y apoyará en las tareas de construcción.2. Fortalecer las capacidades, tanto formativas como de equipamientos, del sistema comunitario de salud del Batey La Balsa en temas de salud comunitaria, prevención de violencia contra las mujeres y derechos sexuales y reproductivos. Para ello se llevarán a cabo sesiones de refuerzo con las 15 promotoras que conforman la Rede de Salud Comunitaria del Batey. Este refuerzo se ha diseñado conjuntamente con la Dirección Provincial de Salud y el Ministerio de la Mujer desde un enfoque de género con el objetivo de mejorar la calidad de vida de las mujeres y niñas del Batey para incidir en problemas de violencia en todas sus manifestaciones. Además, se complementará el equipamiento del Hogar Comunitaria y Salud y se trabajará con las mujeres del Batey en cuestiones relacionadas con la autoestima y los derechos sexuales y reproductivos. 3. Promover una cultura de la igualdad y equidad de género. Se llevarán a cabo talleres en centros educativos para la promoción de una vida sin violencia. Se llevarán a cabo en colaboración con los Ministerios de Educación y de la Mujer con los que se han firmado convenios de colaboración. Se trabajará especialmente con hombres jóvenes y adultos en la construcción de nuevas masculinidades, reflexionando sobre la construcción de las identidades masculinas y analizando las raíces de la violencia.",11.1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,3

BURKINA FASO.,OWN PROGRAMME: SCHOLARSHIP FOR DEGREE FINAL PROJECT. Burkina Faso.,"A lo largo del proyecto ha habido muchos cambios debido a las condiciones en las que nos encontrábamos. Inicialmente planteé tres objetivos: 1.Realizar un estudio documental de tipo de vivienda tradicional de Baasnéré, Burkina Faso. 2.Participar en la ejecución del proyecto de La escuela de secundaria de Baasnéré, con la ayuda de Algemesí Solidari y A3B3.Aplicar los conocimientos adquiridos en el proyecto de La biblioteca del Raval situado en Algemesí. Todos han sido tratados, unos en mayor medida que otros, pero han sido analizados. Una de las cosas que he aprendido allí es que tus planes pueden cambiar constantemente ya que la climatología y la forma de vida que se lleva condiciona mucho el trabajo y como plantear las cosas. Debido a estos aspectos, me he centrado más en el proyecto constructivo que en el análisis de las viviendas, la supervisión de la obra requería más horas de las que pensábamos, aún así, todo el proceso con los BTC ha sido ventajoso para el futuro desarrollo de documentación de la vivienda tradicional. Por una parte el sistema constructivo de la escuela es similar al autóctono y por otra parte, el equipo de obreros, habitantes de Baasnéré, conocía la técnica y había realizado pequeñas obras en el poblado Burkinés. El proyecto de la biblioteca del Raval empieza a desarrollarse ahora, tanto en el ámbito de diseño como en el ámbito material. Espero poder aportar todos mis conocimientos adquiridos en Baasnéré para facilitar y mejorar la futura obraEl principal objetivo del proyecto es realizar una investigación antropológica y arquitectónica quepermitan documentar la historia y evolución de la arquitectura de Baasneere.La población se organiza aparentemente de manera aleatoria, pero sobretodo alrededor de la zonade mercado, punto de encuentro principal. La arquitectura se caracteriza por la utilización demateriales como el mijo y la tierra, dos materiales autóctonos y fáciles de encontrar en la zona.El resultado son pequeñas construcciones cilíndricas con un uso exclusivo de vivienda yalmacenamiento realizados con adobe de tierra cruda y cubiertas cónicas hechas con paja decereales que ellos mismos cultivan (mijo en el caso de Baasneere). Para delimitar el espaciodoméstico se construyen unos muros de adobe que recorren los diferentes edificios, generandouna estructura de patios mas o menos compleja.",,2,2,2,0,,,,1,1,1,1,0.0025,0.0,1

En esta cuarta fase de la intervención se tratará de dar respuesta a esta situación continuando con el trabajo en la región. Así, el objetivo del proyecto es la mejora de las condiciones de acceso a un hábitat domiciliar saludable de la población más vulnerable del departamento de Retalhueu, Guatemala, con énfasis en las mujeres viudas o solteras, a través de un proceso colaborativo entre comunidades, autoridades municipales, organizaciones sociales y cooperativas. Se plantean tres líneas de intervención a lo largo de las dos anualidades presentadas que se complementarán con un adecuado sistema de seguimiento y evaluación del proyecto: 1- Fortalecimiento institucional y comunitario: Como parte del seguimiento al proceso de formación y acompañamiento a las comunidades de Champerico y a las autoridades comunitarias y locales, se busca reforzar y capacitar sobre Producción Social de Vivienda y Hábitat –PSVHA-. Se realizará un Diplomado con los contenidos de esta temática en donde participarán integrantes del Consejo de Autoridades Comunitarias del Sur y Representantes Comunitarios integrantes del COMUDE (Consejo Municipal de Desarrollo) con el objeto de fortalecer la organización comunitaria y la institucionalidad para que a través del conocimiento de la Producción Social de Vivienda y Hábitat puedan promover iniciativas que contribuyan a la mejora del hábitat de las familias de las comunidades de Champerico. 2- Mejora de las condiciones de acceso a un hábitat saludable de 18 familias en condiciones de alta vulnerabilidad mediante la construcción de vivienda: Para dar continuidad a lógica y filosofía de las intervenciones de ASF (Ver anexo 6: Proyectos en colaboración) se generarán dinámicas en torno a la construcción para el fomento del desarrollo autónomo local. En este sentido se fortalecerán las estructuras locales, se contratará a albañiles y profesionales de las comunidades y se involucra las propias familias en el trabajo, además de emplear materiales de la cooperativa B'eljujQ'anil, una iniciativa de producción local con fines sociales. 3- Mejora de hábitos higiénicos y hábitat domiciliar: Se trata de promover prácticas sencillas de limpieza, manejo de los residuos, agua y alimentos etc… que reduzcan los riesgos de contraer las principales enfermedades que afectan estas poblaciones, así como de sentar las bases de un",11.1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,3

En esta quinta fase del programa se mantiene el espíritu de los tres ejes de acción del trabajo: (1) Fortalecimiento institucional y comunitario en materia de derecho al hábitat del municipio de Champerico, (2) Mejora de las condiciones de hábitat  domiciliar saludable de 30 familias en condiciones de alta vulnerabilidad con énfasis en las mujeres viudas y solteras y (3) Mejora de los hábitos higiénicos  domiciliares. Para que las mejoras del entorno  domiciliar sean efectivas y tengan un impacto sobre la salud de la población es necesario que,  paralelamente, lleven procesos adecuados de higiene, limpieza, gestión de residuos, gestión de agua y cuidado de los elementos del entorno  domiciliar.  Con todo, se introducen en cada una de las líneas acciones nuevas orientadas a la mejora del impacto de la intervención, que fueron producto de la reflexión y los aprendizajes internos y de la visión externa que acercaron las evaluaciones finales de los últimos proyectos ejecutados.",11.3,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,3

The Russian war against Ukraine has triggered one of the biggest humanitarian crises of all time and escalated the already difficult housing situation. As a result, more than 5.4 million people were internally displaced at the beginning of 2023. In addition, there are an estimated 5.6 million returnees in Ukraine. While the humanitarian response to the crisis continues, there is an urgent need for housing for internally displaced people and other conflict-affected populations such as host communities. The IOM Displacement Report, 2022, shows that an estimated 785,000 IDPs in Ukraine are planning to integrate in their current location. Of the IDPs who hope to integrate in their current location, 44 percent express a need for resettlement assistance. The aim of the project is therefore to improve the living conditions of inte rnally displaced persons and other population groups affected by the conflict by providing affordable and social housing. To this end, the stock of affordable and social housing in selected municipalities (urban communities) will be increased by 350-400 housing units over a project duration of 60 months, while ensuring the proper maintenance and financial management of this stock.

None of the more than one hundred Kyrgyz Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) lends to low-income people for urgently needed home improvements. The major reason is that such lending is associated with specific risks that MFIs currently are not able to manage. Indeed, low-income earners require a different lending product from banks, as they neither have the savings to make a down-payment, nor do they have regular income which banks would accept. Hence, the goal of the Kyrgyz Housing Microfinance Project, to which the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs SECO has conributed 1 million CHF, is to develop a well targeted Housing Microfinance (HMF) Product to provide access to finance for home improvements and home extensions to low-income Kyrgyz households.

In the considered countries, there is a strong shortage of skilled professionals. Green Buildings bear great potential to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. They contribute to 19% of GHG emissions globally. One important bottleneck in many countries is the lack of skilled architects and engineers needed to increase the inventory of energy efficient buildings.

The major reason is that such lending is associated with specific risks that MFIs currently are not able to manage. Indeed, low-income earners require a different lending product from banks, as they neither have the savings to make a down-payment, nor do they have regular income which banks would accept. Hence, the goal of the Kyrgyz Housing Microfinance Project, to which the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs SECO has conributed 1 million CHF, is to develop a well targeted Housing Microfinance (HMF) Product to provide access to finance for home improvements and home extensions to low-income Kyrgyz households.

The objective of this project is therefore to develop a tailored Housing Microfinance lending product, which is linked to the provision of non-financial services, so that low-income residents can obtain financing for their basic home improvements.",,0,1,0,,,,,0,1,1,0,,0.9353,3

In the considered countries, there is a strong shortage of skilled professionals. Green Buildings bear great potential to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. They contribute to 19% of GHG emissions globally. One important bottleneck in many countries is the lack of skilled architects and engineers needed to increase the inventory of energy efficient buildings.

So-called Housing Microfinance Loans for these home improvements will be provided by banks or microfinance institutions. Kyrgyzstan is one of the poorest post-soviet countries. The majority of low-income residents live in single family houses, with low quality housing standars. In order to do these improvements, most residents need to take up a loan.

Entre las problemáticas específicas que enfrentan las PcD en el municipio de Santiago de Cuba, restrictivas de su calidad de vida y participación socioeconómica, se encuentra su baja empleabilidad, la cual también afecta a la unidad familiar, en particular a las mujeres. Las principales causas que inciden en esta problemática y sobre las que el proyecto busca incidir son: - Las limitadas capacidades de las OSC y las entidades públicas locales para generar servicios inclusivos y programas integrados de apoyo a la inserción socio-laboral de las PcD.

Beginning in 2004, ADB has provided four facility-type TA projects to the PRC to deliver flexible and timely knowledge products and services to the government to respond effectively to emerging policies and capacity development needs. The first two facility-type TA, closed respectively in 2006 and 2010, were rated as successful and their outputs were used in formulating emerging policies and strengthening government capacity. In addition to the country-specific facility TA, ongoing regional TA (RETA 6428) also supports the governments of the PRC and Mongolia to develop strategic and timely knowledge products and services (KPS). ADB's responsiveness to the PRC's government requests for policy advice will be critical over the next few years, when the government will (i) prepare the Twelfth Five-Year Plan (12th FYP) (2011-2015), (ii) formulate policy measures and reforms to mitigate the adverse effects of the economic slowdown, and (iii) support the rebalancing of its growth strategy. Despite the considerable progress the PRC has made in terms of overall economic growth, critical gaps and imbalances remain, including between economic and social development, rural and urban areas, and western and coastal regions. The 2008 global economic crisis has further exacerbated these imbalances, which could pose an obstacle to the achievement of social harmony. The key development constraints to be addressed include (i) low productivity growth, particularly in rural areas and remote regions, (ii) inadequate provision of social services and social protection, particularly in rural areas, remote regions, and among the poor and vulnerable groups, and (iii) weak institutions and capacity as well as constrained knowledge among responsible government agencies. The government continues to have a critical need for assistance relating to policy recommendations and capacity building, to enable it to quickly and effectively formulate and execute policies to mitigate adverse impacts on its citizens and vulnerable groups in particular during the economic slowdown. The implementation period of the proposed TA will coincide with the period during which the Government formulates the policy directions for the 12th FYP. The proposed TA will strengthen the strategic partnership and cooperation between the PRC and ADB on the country's development agenda, based on the PRC's needs and ADB's strengths. Cooperation under the proposed TA will contribute to achieving the goals of the Government's development agenda and ADB's long-term strategic framework 2008-2020 (Strategy 2020), which incorporate the same strategic agendas: inclusive growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration.",,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,,3

It will fund select evaluations and related outreach activities from both the derived operational (i.e., country and sector program evaluations) and knowledge (i.e., thematic,  corporate and impact evaluations, topical working papers) programs of the Independent Evaluation Department (IED). These include, but are not limited to:1. Country assistance program evaluations (CAPEs) and validations of country partnership strategy final reviews. The TA will fund at least two CAPEs (second-generation CAPEs for Papua New Guinea and the Peoples Republic of China), and validations of at least three country partnership strategy (CPS) final reviews (Bangladesh, Lao Peoples Democratic Republic, and Timor Leste). Each CAPE will evaluate ADB support to the country and cover ADB strategy, policy dialogue, completed and ongoing projects and TA, and ADB performance. It will provide ADB and the developing member country (DMC) with an evaluative basis of use for designing the future CPS. When appropriate, country sector assessments will provide inputs during the preparation of a CAPE. Each sector assessment will evaluate ADB performance within a given sector in the country, focusing again on strategy, policy dialogue, ongoing and completed projects and TA, and performance.2. Review of Asian Development Fund (ADF) Operations. The thematic evaluation study (TES) will review the commitments made under the ADF X and XI replenishments and assess the relevance, responsiveness, and results of ADF operations over the said period. It will comprise a desk review of selected project documents, evaluation reports, and pertinent literature. DMC consultations may be undertaken in a range of countries, a perception survey held, along with country portfolio reviews covering all five regions. 3. Environmentally Sustainable Growth. The TES will review the design and implementation of ADB's 2002 Environment Policy and subsequent directional documents.4. Effectiveness of ADB's Partnerships. The TES will evaluate the effectiveness of ADB partnerships through a review of such agreements, co-financing partnership arrangements, and related documents.5. ADB Risk Management Practices for Non-sovereign Operations (NSOs). The TES will assess the relevance, efficiency, and effectiveness of ADB's risk management policies (e.g., exposure limits), systems and processes for NSO to identify any required enhancements that can facilitate the development effectiveness and sustainability of NSO.6. Impact evaluations. The TA will support at least one impact evaluation (most likely related to energy). 7. Other sector and thematic assessments, and topical working papers.

The project will have the following outcome: housing affordability for low-income individuals in designated communities improved. The outputs are: Output 1. Climate and disaster resilient, and affordable housing units and public facilities for low-income individuals constructed. This project component will leverage the National Housing Development Corporation Limited's (NHDCL) access to developable, serviced land to build an estimated 1,000 units for rent (with the opportunity for home ownership) and six integrated community service centers, serviced with roads, electricity, municipal, water and sewerage connections in support of the Sustainable Development Goal 1. This output includes components under the Asian Development Fund Thematic Pool grant to provide decent accommodation for families of urban workers, integrated service centers, and livelihood support for women. It is expected that the increase in supply of affordable houses will mitigate the rental shortage. The mid-rise multi-unit buildings will incorporate gender inclusive features and innovations in design, construction methodology, and operation and maintenance including the application of resilient and smart technology to improve resource-efficiency and greater use of locally available materials to boost local economic development. Climate and disaster resilient design features will be identified through a site risk assessment and take a multi-hazard approach. Bhutan cultural values and traditional architecture, aimed at improved public housing amenity, and green facilities will be reflected in the project. Additionally the site plans for each site will be designed in accordance with urban planning guidelines to incorporate appropriate green and public spaces for the location.
