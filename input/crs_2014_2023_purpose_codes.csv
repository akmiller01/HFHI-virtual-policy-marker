Para ello se construirán 57 viviendas dignas en la aldea de Kachikunta, asegurando que la propiedad quede en manos de las mujeres o personas con discapacidad. También se promoverá un entorno habitable para lo cual se dotará de sistema de saneamiento básico a cada vivienda (letrina), se llevará el tendido eléctrico a la comunidad, se dará acceso a agua potable y se mejorará el urbanismo de la comunidad con el asfaltado de las calles. Es el resultado del trabajo entre el Panchayat (gobierno local), el Comité de Desarrollo Comunitario (CDC), los beneficiarios y beneficiarias y la contraparte local, para acceder a unas condiciones de habitabilidad adecuadas. El colectivo beneficiario de la aldea de Kachikunta pertenece a las castas bajas vakkalinga, mala y madiga, tradicional y socialmente excluidas. Ahora viven en chozas deterioradas, poco salubres e inseguras, que perpetúan su vulnerabilidad, especialmente de las mujeres, empeorada porque no hay acceso cercano a agua segura, electricidad ni acceso a saneamiento básico. Una vez ejecutado, 54 mujeres y 3 hombres tendrán una vivienda en propiedad que cumpla condiciones de habitabilidad digna. Un total de 232 personas, 113 mujeres y niñas, tendrán acceso a servicios básicos de habitabilidad como agua, electricidad y saneamiento. Como resultado de la política de integración de la FVF-RDT, 5 de las viviendas estarán habilitadas para personas con discapacidad.

Het militaire partnerschap met de Democratische Republiek Congo omvat vooral de vorming van, toezicht op en evaluatie van een 'URR' brigade (Unité de Réaction Rapide   - een soort paracommando's) bestaande uit drie elite bataljons (321e, 322e en 323e Bataillons de Réaction Rapide) te Kindu, naast de vorming, de begeleiding en evaluatie van de onderrichters van de Militaire Academie van Kananga en van de Genieschool in Likasi. Het 321e bataljon werd eind 2008 -begin 2009 gevormd te Kananga, het 322e bataljon eind 2011 -begin 2012 te Kindu en tenslotte het 323e bataljon in de loop van 2013 te Kindu. Blijft nog de vorming van de staf van de brigade die de drie gevormde elite bataljons zal omkaderen. Wanneer een militair in de Democratische Republiek Congo een standplaats krijgt toegewezen om er tijdelijk te verblijven, trekt zijn gezin bijna altijd mee. Deze verplaatsingen resulteren vaak in moeilijke levensomstandigheden voor de families. Die families dienen op zoek te gaan naar een onderkomen, naar gezondheidszorgen, naar een school voor hun kinderen en naar landbouwgrond om voedsel te kunnen produceren. Dit gebeurt vaak ten koste van de lokale populatie met conflicten als gevolg. Om aan deze tendens een halt toe te roepen, willen de Congolese regering en de Stafdienst van het leger (FARDC – Forces Armées de la République Démocratique du Congo) de militairen en hun gezin een vaste woonplaats bezorgen. Het is de bedoeling de militairen te huisvesten in garnizoensteden verspreid over het hele land. Zo zullen de militairen die op missie vertrekken, gerust gesteld zijn dat hun familie veilig en degelijk gehuisvest is.Kindu gelegen in de provincie Maniema is één van die garnizoensteden. De drie door België opgeleide bataljons worden gehuisvest te Kindu en omgeving, meer bepaald het 321e bataljon in het militaire kamp Lwama, het 322e bataljon in het militaire kamp Lokandu en het 323e bataljon in het militaire kamp Jericho.Nu bevonden deze militaire kampen zich in een lamentabele toestand wegens verwaarlozing ingevolge de oorlogen die de DRC de laatste jaren had gekend. De Belgische defensie in zijn partnerschapsakkoord met de DRC voorziet in de rehabilitatie van de infrastructuur van die kampen maar er waren onvoldoende fondsen voorzien voor de huisvesting van de militairen. Bijgevolg werd aan onze FOD Buitenlandse Zaken, Buitenlandse Handel en Ontwikkelingssamenwerking in het kader van een 3D benadering (défence, diplomatie et développement) gevraagd financieel bij te dragen voor de rehabilitatie van de huisvesting in deze kampen. In een eerste fase werd besloten het kamp Lwama te Kindu te rehabil",,1,1,1,,,,,0,0,0,0,,0.0,3

Estas viviendas forman parte de un proyecto de América Solidaria desarrollado entre 2006 y 2009 que consistió en repartir a cada familia los materiales necesarios para construir una casa pero sin proporcionar ningún tipo de mano de obra ni supervisión de los trabajos. El problema fue que las familias no tenían dinero para contratar a ninguna persona que construyera las casas ni los conocimientos para hacerlo ellos mismos. El resultado fue viviendas sin vigas, pilares sin armadura o con armadura insuficiente, muros mal trabados.. y en consecuencia cuando se produjo el terremoto la mayoría de las casas colapsaron. El proyecto Bati Kay 2.9 tiene dos objetivos principales. En primer lugar reforzar la estructura y consolidarla para que no sea un peligro para sus habitantes y además utilizar técnicas constructivas apropiadas que trabajen mejor en caso de seísmo proporcionando una mejora arquitectónica al edificio.",,1,0,0,0,,,,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0022,1

Para ello se realizará un trabajo en tres ejes: a) Instalación de cocinas mejoradas ahorradoras de leña. b) Capacitación del uso de la cocina, mantenimiento, higiene y medidas de salubridad. c) Reforestación con árboles de rápido crecimiento para la obtención de leña para consumo, asegurando un manejo sostenible del bosque, y capacitación en gestión ambiental. Se atenderá la problemática de que las familias indígenas cocinen en la única estancia del hogar, utilizando un sistema rudimentario (prácticamente una hoguera) lo que provoca humo que se concentra en el interior de la vivienda. Esta práctica acarrea importantes problemas a la familia y su entorno: produce patologías respiratorias y oculares sobre todo en mujeres y niños que son quienes pasan más tiempo en el hogar, supone un consumo excesivo de leña que agrava los problemas de deforestación y el avance de la frontera agrícola, ocupa mucho tiempo y es un trabajo muy duro para las mujeres, y ha provocado graves accidentes caseros por quemaduras y abrasiones. El análisis técnico sobre los índices de morbilidad y deterioro ambiental, realizado por la Oficina Municipal de Planificación y las comisiones de Salud, Medio Ambiente y líderes comunitarios, permitió conocer de qué manera se ve afectada la población, el humo, es una de las causas más importantes de las enfermedades respiratorias y oculares. El proyecto se desarrollará en comunidades rurales de San Miguel Uspantán, Dpto. El Quiché (Guatemala), y es destinado a mejorar las condiciones de habitabilidad de 284 familias (974 mujeres y 1014 hombres) en situación de pobreza y pobreza extrema, indígenas de la etnia Quiché, conformadas por un promedio de 7 personas. La mayoría son analfabetos/as o con nivel educativo muy bajo y no dimensionan los efectos en la salud de la inhalación prolongada de humo ni la presión que ejercen sobre el medio ambiente por el consumo indiscriminado de leña. Con el objetivo específico de la mejora de las condiciones de habitabilidad mediante la construcción de cocinas mejoradas, se pretende incidir en la calidad de vida de 284 familias indígenas de la zona rural de San Miguel Uspantán, al actuar a través de tres ejes: construcción de la cocina mejorada, capacitación y reforestación. Con todo ello se facilitará el trabajo a las mujeres, se mejorará su salud y la de sus hijos, y destinará menor tiempo a la cocina y a la recogida de leña, todo ello influirá en la mejora de sus condiciones de vida.",,1,1,0,0,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,3

El 82.3% de los hogares presentan alguna condición de pobreza, de esa población, el 54.7% se encuentra en condiciones de pobreza extrema, y afecta principalmente a las poblaciones de las zonas rurales. Aunque Nicaragua en los últimos años ha experimentado una etapa de crecimiento económico, sigue estando por debajo de la media regional, y continua siendo uno de los países más desiguales del continente americano, desigualdad que se acrecienta en las poblaciones rurales y más aún indígenas, como es el caso de Bailadora nº 2, comunidad objeto de la actual intervención. Tras la exitosa intervención desarrolladas en la fase 1 en la colindante Bailadora 1 que favoreció a 485 personas de la comunidad menos accesible y desfavorecida de este munipicio, este proyecto se desarrollará en la comunidad rural Bailadora nº2 (Municipio San Ramón en Matagalpa y colindante geográficamente a la anterior). A través de la presente intervención se pretende la mejora de las condiciones de habitabilidad básica y de las condiciones sociosanitarias y de alimentación de las familias de la comunidad. Asimismo, se fortalecerá la organización comunitaria como solución integral en la toma de decisiones para afrontar los problemas de salud, medioambiente, y seguridad alimentaría por medio de capacitaciones y recursos para lograr una producción diversificada que enriquezca su dieta alimenticia. Así, se desarrollarán las capacidades de autogestión de sus miembros y de la junta directiva de la comunidad, con el fin de garantizar la sostenibilidad y continuidad del proyecto tras la finalización de la ayuda externa.",,1,0,0,0,,,,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.1911,1

None of the more than one hundred Kyrgyz Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) lends to low-income people for urgently needed home improvements. The major reason is that such lending is associated with specific risks that MFIs currently are not able to manage. Indeed, low-income earners require a different lending product from banks, as they neither have the savings to make a down-payment, nor do they have regular income which banks would accept. Hence, the goal of the Kyrgyz Housing Microfinance Project, to which the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs SECO has conributed 1 million CHF, is to develop a well targeted Housing Microfinance (HMF) Product to provide access to finance for home improvements and home extensions to low-income Kyrgyz households. It is expected that within 2 years after Project closure partner banks will have about 7% of their total loan portfolio in housing microfinance loans, i.e. USD 5 million in total.",,1,0,0,,,,,0,0,0,0,,0.0164,3

La UCAD nos solicitó ayuda para la construcción de 80 viviendas para 80 familias que estaban en estas condiciones, priorizando a las mujeres viudas, con hijos a su cargo. Con ayudas recibidas de otras Instituciones públicas y privadas (Comunidad de Madrid, Ayuntamiento de Salamanca, el COAATM y Campaña de Acción Verapaz) hemos construido 59 casas. Solicitamos ahora la ayuda para las otras 21 familias. Necesitan y quieren un espacio donde vivir, y unas condiciones sanitarias dignas, para poder así reanudar las actividades que les permita iniciar una nueva vida. Este es el motivo de esta iniciativa de construcción de viviendas en beneficio de 21 mujeres y sus familias, damnificadas desde hace cuatro años por la tragedia de enero 2010, que lo perdieron todo en Puerto Príncipe.",,1,0,0,0,,,,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.1048,1

En el caso concreto de Santiago hay 91 campamentos en los que viven 3612 familias. Campamentos son los asentamientos donde ocho o más familias, que habitan viviendas agrupadas o contiguas, se encuentran en una situación irregular de tenencia del terreno y carecen de acceso regular a uno o más servicios básicos de la vivienda (agua potable, energía eléctrica y alcantarillado/fosa séptica). El proyecto final de carrera de Arquitectura, comienza con la investigación sobre este tema. Saber cómo se forman los campamentos, por qué actualmente hay gente viviendo en estas condiciones, cómo es su forma de vivir, qué problemas sociales tienen, ha sido información relevante para comenzar mi proyecto. Se continúa investigando el campamento Los Aromos, situado en Colina, a 14 km de distancia de Santiago de Chile. Comencé realizando un estudio urbano, para saber cuántas familias forman el campamento, quién es el propietario del terreno que están ocupando, si se encuentran en una zona de riesgo, y si se podría regularizar la situación. El resultado del proyecto, es una propuesta de viviendas sociales para mejorar la calidad de vida de 150 familias aproximadamente que ahora forman el campamento Los Aromos.",,1,1,0,,,,,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.003,1

En los últimos años los cambios producidos en las necesidades y forma de vida de la población local, están teniendo una repercusión muy importante sobre el hábitat tradicional, que está siendo abandonando en pro de viviendas ejecutadas con bloque de hormigón, situadas en las proximidades. Las carencias observadas en las nuevas construcciones están haciendo que la población vida bajo unas condiciones mínimas de confort, peores que las que les garantizan las viviendas construidas con técnicas tradicionales. Es por ello por lo que es necesario poner en valor los sistemas de construcción tradicional como garantía de un modelo de vida digno,aportando conocimiento sobre sus características técnicas y bioclimáticas. Además la pérdida de valores culturales de la población bereber, la emigración, la pérdida de oficios tradicionales, la transformación del modelo de hábitat y la desertización agravan el problema. Con el presente proyecto se pretende avanzar en el conocimiento de la Arquitectura Habitacional de Tierra de la región del Tafilalt, con el objeto de establecer estrategias de mejora sobre este hábitat sostenible que contribuyan a la erradicación del concepto de infravivienda, a la vez que emplear el conocimiento adquirido como fuente de activación de la economía local, al contribuir a la formación de jóvenes con riesgo de exclusión social.",,1,0,0,0,,,,0,0,0,0,0.0149,0.0,1

These include, but are not limited to:1. Country assistance program evaluations (CAPEs) and validations of country partnership strategy final reviews. The TA will fund at least two CAPEs (second-generation CAPEs for Papua New Guinea and the Peoples Republic of China), and validations of at least three country partnership strategy (CPS) final reviews (Bangladesh, Lao Peoples Democratic Republic, and Timor Leste). Each CAPE will evaluate ADB support to the country and cover ADB strategy, policy dialogue, completed and ongoing projects and TA, and ADB performance. It will provide ADB and the developing member country (DMC) with an evaluative basis of use for designing the future CPS. When appropriate, country sector assessments will provide inputs during the preparation of a CAPE. Each sector assessment will evaluate ADB performance within a given sector in the country, focusing again on strategy, policy dialogue, ongoing and completed projects and TA, and performance.2. Review of Asian Development Fund (ADF) Operations. The thematic evaluation study (TES) will review the commitments made under the ADF X and XI replenishments and assess the relevance, responsiveness, and results of ADF operations over the said period. It will comprise a desk review of selected project documents, evaluation reports, and pertinent literature. DMC consultations may be undertaken in a range of countries, a perception survey held, along with country portfolio reviews covering all five regions. 3. Environmentally Sustainable Growth. The TES will review the design and implementation of ADB's 2002 Environment Policy and subsequent directional documents.4. Effectiveness of ADB's Partnerships. The TES will evaluate the effectiveness of ADB partnerships through a review of such agreements, co-financing partnership arrangements, and related documents.5. ADB Risk Management Practices for Non-sovereign Operations (NSOs). The TES will assess the relevance, efficiency, and effectiveness of ADB's risk management policies (e.g., exposure limits), systems and processes for NSO to identify any required enhancements that can facilitate the development effectiveness and sustainability of NSO.6. Impact evaluations. The TA will support at least one impact evaluation (most likely related to energy). 7. Other sector and thematic assessments, and topical working papers.

Med najbolj prizadetimi so družine, ki jih sestavljajo otroci-sirote, ki živijo v zasilnih šotorih, ki ne varujejo pred vremenskimi vplivi, pogosto zbolijo ter so ve?inoma podhranjeni.Cilj projekta je, da se z naselitvijo v varnih hišah otrokom zagotovi splošna varnost, varovanje pred kriminalom, izboljša fizi?no in psihi?no zdravje. Poleg tega projekt ima za cilj tudi zmanjšanje hude revš?ine in odpravljanje lakote preko vzpostavljanja sistema zagotavljanja dolgotrajne prehranske varnosti otrok. Dolgoro?en cilj projekta je omogo?iti otrokom, da bi lahko obiskovali šolo. Z boljšo izobrazbo se jim bodo pove?ale zaposlitvene možnosti in tako se bo na dolgi rok zmanjšala revš?ina.    Projekt predvideva, da bo v obdobju dveh let zgrajenih 108 hiš s pripadajo?im zemljiš?em. Poleg tega bo v okviru projekta 108 družin prejelo kmetijski paket (s pripadajo?im usposabljanjem in izobraževanjem o kmetovanju) in 432 otrok bo prejelo paket šolskih potrebš?in.Celotna vrednost projekta znaša 60.000 EUR.",,0,0,0,,,,,0,0,0,,,,3

None of the more than one hundred Kyrgyz Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) lends to low-income people for urgently needed home improvements. The major reason is that such lending is associated with specific risks that MFIs currently are not able to manage. Indeed, low-income earners require a different lending product from banks, as they neither have the savings to make a down-payment, nor do they have regular income which banks would accept. Hence, the goal of the Kyrgyz Housing Microfinance Project, to which the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs SECO has conributed 1 million CHF, is to develop a well targeted Housing Microfinance (HMF) Product to provide access to finance for home improvements and home extensions to low-income Kyrgyz households. It is expected that within 2 years after Project closure partner banks will have about 7% of their total loan portfolio in housing microfinance loans, i.e. USD 5 million in total.",,1,0,0,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,3

Faced with enormous challenges in providing shelter and services of any kind, there are many projects which attempt to improve living conditions. But they do so with little co-ordination or useful information on exactly the scale and extent of the problems. Through a new organisation linked to the University, this project will train and support people to bring existing and new information together on Freetowns slums with the aim of contributing to Freetowns first urban development plan. This could significant improve the quality and coordination of services in the slums, leading to slums dwellers being more secure, safe and better off.

En enero de 2014 en el citado barrio se identifican, entre otras, estas necesidades: de las 149 familias, 118 de sus casas estaban totalmente dañadas, 38 de ellas con posibilidades de reconstruirse por sus propietarios, mientras que 80 familias cuentan con escasos recursos para hacerse cargo de su reconstrucción. Es un proyecto socio-comunitario basado en la solidaridad y ayuda mutua.

HIRD focuses on rural housing as an engine for economic transformation and accelerating rural development. Planned communities, modern house designs, new construction technology and materials, and more environmentally sustainable construction solutions are advancing the construction sector and providing opportunities for Uzbek entrepreneurs and industries. As part of HIRD up to 10,000 homes are being built per year, creating opportunities for up to 1,000 small rural contractors and 100,000 rural construction jobs annually. Improved access to nearby schools and clinics is a key part of this program. More reliable electricity, gas, and water supply, combined with community designs that include space for retail shops and commercial services, are opening up opportunities for home-based businesses. HIRD is an important driver for the 500,000 rural micro and small enterprises and home-based jobs targeted each year. On 31 August 2011, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved a $500 million multitranche financing facility (MFF) for the Housing for Integrated Rural Development (HIRD) Investment Program principally to provide financing to participating commercial banks (PCBs) for onlending to more than 40,000 targeted rural homebuyers.  Under HIRD, subloans financed by the MFF help support construction of new modern houses built in planned rural community sites, with serviced land plots with electricity, gas, water supply and sanitation, and roads provided by local governments. Local governments also provide access to and improvements in nearby schools and medical clinics, and are making space available for new retail shops and commercial services.",,1,0,,,,,,,,,,,,3

Beginning in 2004, ADB has provided four facility-type TA projects to the PRC to deliver flexible and timely knowledge products and services to the government to respond effectively to emerging policies and capacity development needs. The first two facility-type TA, closed respectively in 2006 and 2010, were rated as successful and their outputs were used in formulating emerging policies and strengthening government capacity. In addition to the country-specific facility TA, ongoing regional TA (RETA 6428) also supports the governments of the PRC and Mongolia to develop strategic and timely knowledge products and services (KPS). ADB's responsiveness to the PRC's government requests for policy advice will be critical over the next few years, when the government will (i) prepare the Twelfth Five-Year Plan (12th FYP) (2011-2015), (ii) formulate policy measures and reforms to mitigate the adverse effects of the economic slowdown, and (iii) support the rebalancing of its growth strategy. Despite the considerable progress the PRC has made in terms of overall economic growth, critical gaps and imbalances remain, including between economic and social development, rural and urban areas, and western and coastal regions. The 2008 global economic crisis has further exacerbated these imbalances, which could pose an obstacle to the achievement of social harmony. The key development constraints to be addressed include (i) low productivity growth, particularly in rural areas and remote regions, (ii) inadequate provision of social services and social protection, particularly in rural areas, remote regions, and among the poor and vulnerable groups, and (iii) weak institutions and capacity as well as constrained knowledge among responsible government agencies. The government continues to have a critical need for assistance relating to policy recommendations and capacity building, to enable it to quickly and effectively formulate and execute policies to mitigate adverse impacts on its citizens and vulnerable groups in particular during the economic slowdown. The implementation period of the proposed TA will coincide with the period during which the Government formulates the policy directions for the 12th FYP. The proposed TA will strengthen the strategic partnership and cooperation between the PRC and ADB on the country's development agenda, based on the PRC's needs and ADB's strengths. Cooperation under the proposed TA will contribute to achieving the goals of the Government's development agenda and ADB's long-term strategic framework 2008-2020 (Strategy 2020), which incorporate the same strategic agendas: inclusive growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration.",,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,,3

María de los Robles :: El Hogar de Apoyo Terapéutico Santa María de los Robles (HATSMR), está ubicado en el barrio Caracolí, al sur de la cuidad de Bogotá, en Colombia. Tuvo su origen en el año 2003, a partir de las visitas realizadas por Religiosas Esclavas del Sagrado Corazón de Jesús y el acompañamiento de personas voluntarias del barrio Caracolí, en Ciudad Bolívar en Bogotá ? Colombia, a familias con miembros con discapacidad (condición de discapacidad física, cognitiva, social y mental), de éste sector. En éstas visitas se detectaron las condiciones de vida de las familias, así como factores de vulnerabilidad: salud (falta de acceso al servicio médico), educación (analfabetismo), vivienda (hacinamiento, carencia de servicios públicos) y socio-culturales (desplazamiento, violencia, carencia de trabajo estable), a las que se veían expuestas. Se inició un trabajo encaminado a la búsqueda de estrategias para abordar algunas de estas problemáticas orientadas a las madres en su mayoría cabezas de hogar, por medio de talleres y capacitaciones. El Hogar de Apoyo se ha convertido en un espacio que ha ido ganando fuerza e influencia en la comunidad debido a su impacto y a la forma de generar desarrollo comunitario en las familias de las personas con discapacidad. Este año se espera atender un total de beneficiarios directos: 155 niños, 70 adultos, 82 familias, sin distinto geográfico, étnico, religioso, cultural. Contamos con un equipo de profesionales multidisciplinarios, que valoran las habilidades de cada uno y desde sus capacidades, orientan su desarrollo humano integral, a través de programas de capacitación y alfabetización para Madres, terapias integrales y multidisciplinarias, para los beneficiarios diversamente hábiles, ludoteca y taller de música para los niños/as del barrio Nuestra objetivo es seguir aumentando la cobertura de familias, lograr la alfabetización de las Madres (hay 6 madres cabeza de familia en el proyecto de alfabetización) lo cual es esencial como inicio para la preparación y capacitación hacia proyectos productivos según gustos, aptitudes y capacidades, permitirles acceder a una ingreso fijo y constante que mejore las condiciones de vida del núcleo familiar, de manera prioritaria, al integrante diversamente hábil, de las mismas, para darles una salida ocupacional y productiva. Lo que ha hecho posible el trabajo constante en el Hogar, en cuanto a terapias, talleres a madres, gestión de redes, posicionamiento en la zona por la calidad del servicio que se presta. La fundación PROACIS apoya con recursos económicos desde el año 2007 el programa de atención profesional a personas con discapacidad. Lo que ha hecho posible el trabajo constante en el Hogar, en cuanto a terapias, talleres a madres, gestión de redes, posicionamiento en la zona por la calidad del servicio que se presta.

Toilets and water are a rarity. By coming together and demanding recognition and basic facilities in return for the fees they pay, a national group is starting to change things.  This project will help increase membership of the group and ensure that the police and council officials understand what traders are allowed to do. It will also negotiate for traders to receive loans and train them in business skills. As their lives become more stable they will be able to increase earnings and improve their working conditions.

Es el resultado del trabajo entre los beneficiarios/as, el Comité de Desarrollo Comunitario (CDC) y la contraparte local, con la colaboración del gobierno local y los vecinos y vecinas. Se construirán 83 viviendas dignas en las aldeas de Mulapalli y Ganjivaripalli, asegurando jurídicamente la propiedad al 96,4% de las mujeres. Desde una perspectiva estratégica, se va a incidir en el suministro de agua segura en las dos aldeas. En una de ellas se ha optado por el suministro en todas las viviendas de la aldea, y la otra con acceso a través de grifos públicos suficientes. Esta nueva experiencia para la entidad, avalada en la identificación con un análisis del recurso hídrico, va a servir para estudiar las dos opciones. Es importante también dotar a los asentamientos de un entorno habitable: se construirán baños con letrinas individuales, se llevará el tendido eléctrico, y se mejorará el urbanismo de la comunidad con un trazado homogéneo y asfaltado de las calles. Sus asentamientos actuales no satisfacen ninguno de estos derechos y necesidades básicas. Habitan en chozas deterioradas, poco salubres e inseguras, que perpetúan su vulnerabilidad, especialmente de las mujeres. Las circunstancias de cada comunidad difieren en los detalles, pero todos se encuentran por debajo del umbral de la pobreza, pertenecen o bien a castas bajas o son dálits, con una historia de exclusión a sus espaldas determinada por nacimiento. Un total de 321 personas, 46,73% mujeres y niñas, tendrán acceso a habitabilidad básica completa con vivienda, agua, electricidad y saneamiento, y en adicción 355 personas, el 47,88% mujeres y niñas, tendrán acceso a agua segura.

Het militaire partnerschap met de Democratische Republiek Congo omvat vooral de vorming van, toezicht op en evaluatie van een 'URR' brigade (Unité de Réaction Rapide   - een soort paracommando's) bestaande uit drie elite bataljons (321e, 322e en 323e Bataillons de Réaction Rapide) te Kindu, naast de vorming, de begeleiding en evaluatie van de onderrichters van de Militaire Academie van Kananga en van de Genieschool in Likasi. Het 321e bataljon werd eind 2008 -begin 2009 gevormd te Kananga, het 322e bataljon eind 2011 -begin 2012 te Kindu en tenslotte het 323e bataljon in de loop van 2013 te Kindu. Blijft nog de vorming van de staf van de brigade die de drie gevormde elite bataljons zal omkaderen.   Wanneer een militair in de Democratische Republiek Congo een standplaats krijgt toegewezen om er tijdelijk te verblijven, trekt zijn gezin bijna altijd mee. Deze verplaatsingen resulteren vaak in moeilijke levensomstandigheden voor de families. Die families dienen op zoek te gaan naar een onderkomen, naar gezondheidszorgen, naar een school voor hun kinderen en naar landbouwgrond om voedsel te kunnen produceren. Dit gebeurt vaak ten koste van de lokale populatie met conflicten als gevolg.  Om aan deze tendens een halt toe te roepen, willen de Congolese regering en de Stafdienst van het leger (FARDC – Forces Armées de la République Démocratique du Congo) de militairen en hun gezin een vaste woonplaats bezorgen. Het is de bedoeling de militairen te huisvesten in garnizoensteden verspreid over het hele land. Zo zullen de militairen die op missie vertrekken, gerust gesteld zijn dat hun familie veilig en degelijk gehuisvest is. Kindu gelegen in de provincie Maniema is één van die garnizoensteden. De drie door België opgeleide bataljons worden gehuisvest te Kindu en omgeving, meer bepaald het 321e bataljon in het militaire kamp Lwama, het 322e bataljon in het militaire kamp Lokandu en het 323e bataljon in het militaire kamp Jericho. Nu bevonden deze militaire kampen zich in een lamentabele toestand wegens verwaarlozing ingevolge de oorlogen die de DRC de laatste jaren had gekend. De Belgische defensie in zijn partnerschapsakkoord met de DRC voorziet in de rehabilitatie van de infrastructuur van die kampen maar er waren onvoldoende fondsen voorzien voor de huisvesting van de militairen. Bijgevolg werd aan onze FOD Buitenlandse Zaken, Buitenlandse Handel en Ontwikkelingssamenwerking in het kader van een 3D benadering (défence, diplomatie et développement) gevraagd financieel bij te dragen voor de rehabilitatie van de huisvesting in deze kampen. In een eerste fase werd besloten het kamp Lwama te Kindu te re",,1,1,1,0,,,,0,0,0,0,,0.0,3

Es el resultado del trabajo entre los beneficiarios/as, el Comité de Desarrollo Comunitario (CDC) y la contraparte local, con la colaboración del gobierno local y los vecinos y vecinas. Se construirán 83 viviendas dignas en las aldeas de Mulapalli y Ganjivaripalli, asegurando jurídicamente la propiedad al 96,4% de las mujeres. Desde una perspectiva estratégica, se va a incidir en el suministro de agua segura en las dos aldeas. En una de ellas se ha optado por el suministro en todas las viviendas de la aldea, y la otra con acceso a través de grifos públicos suficientes. Esta nueva experiencia para la entidad, avalada en la identificación con un análisis del recurso hídrico, va a servir para estudiar las dos opciones. Es importante también dotar a los asentamientos de un entorno habitable: se construirán baños con letrinas individuales, se llevará el tendido eléctrico, y se mejorará el urbanismo de la comunidad con un trazado homogéneo y asfaltado de las calles. Sus asentamientos actuales no satisfacen ninguno de estos derechos y necesidades básicas. Habitan en chozas deterioradas, poco salubres e inseguras, que perpetúan su vulnerabilidad, especialmente de las mujeres. Las circunstancias de cada comunidad difieren en los detalles, pero todos se encuentran por debajo del umbral de la pobreza, pertenecen o bien a castas bajas o son dálits, con una historia de exclusión a sus espaldas determinada por nacimiento. Un total de 321 personas, 46,73% mujeres y niñas, tendrán acceso a habitabilidad básica completa con vivienda, agua, electricidad y saneamiento, y en adicción 355 personas, el 47,88% mujeres y niñas, tendrán acceso a agua segura. Se potenciará la capacidad de autogestión de la comunidad, potenciando la participación de las mujeres, tanto en el origen, ejecución y seguimiento de las obras, consolidando sus aptitudes y confianza en sí mismas, como personas y como colectivo.",,2,1,1,0,,,,0,0,1,0,0.0,0.0,3

Para ello se construirán 57 viviendas dignas en la aldea de Kachikunta, asegurando que la propiedad quede en manos de las mujeres o personas con discapacidad. También se promoverá un entorno habitable para lo cual se dotará de sistema de saneamiento básico a cada vivienda (letrina), se llevará el tendido eléctrico a la comunidad, se dará acceso a agua potable y se mejorará el urbanismo de la comunidad con el asfaltado de las calles. Es el resultado del trabajo entre el Panchayat (gobierno local), el Comité de Desarrollo Comunitario (CDC), los beneficiarios y beneficiarias y la contraparte local, para acceder a unas condiciones de habitabilidad adecuadas. El colectivo beneficiario de la aldea de Kachikunta pertenece a las castas bajas vakkalinga, mala y madiga, tradicional y socialmente excluidas. Ahora viven en chozas deterioradas, poco salubres e inseguras, que perpetúan su vulnerabilidad, especialmente de las mujeres, empeorada porque no hay acceso cercano a agua segura, electricidad ni acceso a saneamiento básico. Una vez ejecutado, 54 mujeres y 3 hombres tendrán una vivienda en propiedad que cumpla condiciones de habitabilidad digna. Un total de 232 personas, 113 mujeres y niñas, tendrán acceso a servicios básicos de habitabilidad como agua, electricidad y saneamiento. Como resultado de la política de integración de la FVF-RDT, 5 de las viviendas estarán habilitadas para personas con discapacidad. Se potenciará la capacidad de autogestión de la comunidad, con especial incidencia en la participación de las mujeres, tanto en el origen, ejecución y seguimiento de las obras, consolidando sus aptitudes y confianza en sí mismas, como personas y como colectivo.",,2,1,1,,,,,0,0,1,0,0.0,0.0,3

Además, son personas que pertenecen a las castas de los últimos escalafones del sistema de castas hindú, sistema abolido por la Constitución india de 1950, que todavía se encuentra muy arraigado en el ámbito rural donde viven las tres cuartas partes de la población del país, y en donde se desarrolla el proyecto.Las casas que construirán RDT/WDT y los beneficiarios y beneficiarías contarán con 4 espacios (2 estancias, un baño y un porche) y en los casos que sea necesario, una rampa que facilite la accesibilidad. Estarán hechas de cemento y ladrillos con una base elevada cubierta de láminas, para evitar la entrada de serpientes y escorpiones. Una vivienda de estas características está provista de las condiciones necesarias de salubridad, constituyendo un resguardo eficaz ante las inclemencias del clima, y proporcionando un ambiente familiar limpio y digno. Todo ello repercutirá en el desarrollo integral de la familia.Beneficiarios directos: La población beneficiaría directa son 28 personas discapacitadas, 10 mujeres y 18 hombres más sus familias, que con una media de 4 personas por familia son un total de 112 personas beneficiarías directas. Los terrenos de las viviendas se inscribirán a nombre de las personas con discapacidad de la familia como primer paso para promover su empoderamiento socio-económico.Las edades van desde los 15 hasta los 48 años, y por tipo de discapacidad, 11 tienen diferentes grados de discapacidad física, 5 discapacidad múltiple, 3 discapacidad intelectual, 5 personas son discapacitados/as auditivas y 4 son personas con discapacidad visual.Beneficiarios indirectos: Al ser un proyecto comunitario y no meramente puntual, los beneficiarios indirectos se extienden en general a las comunidades rurales implicadas, 22.025 personas, y en particular a los miembros de los shangams de personas con discapacidad de las aldeas (163 personas).",,0,0,1,0,,,,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0064,1

Slum dwellers, squatters and poor people are faced with landlessness, evictions, lack of decent housing and inadequate access to basic services. Hostels built during apartheid remain untransformed, with single rooms being occupied by whole families.

Women and children work long hours in highly hazardous conditions for minimal pay. This proposal, which will be run by a local community group, aims to help some of these women make a fresh start, by offering them training in horticulture on land provided by a local school, and then linking them with markets for the produce. A share of the crops will go to the school and be used for feeding the children and providing the school with a small income. The government of the UK (DfID) funded 50 percent of this grant - this share is excluded to avoid double counting in the DAC statistics.

Few people have access to toilets and many of these overflow as there is no emptying system in place. Also solid waste is rarely collected. This project will enable local community groups to take on contracts to empty toilets. They will also run publicity campaigns to make people more aware of the health risks of contaminated water. Water filters and latrines will be sold at low prices, and local people will be assisted to start up their own businesses to collect, recycle, and sell waste: the compost will then be used for producing flowers and vegetables.

Improbably, a group who came together through playing football, are now looking for better lives. They raised funds to train single mothers and young people, helping them get jobs while supporting children into local schools. This project will provide small grants for food and housing and provide further training. With proper jobs they can face a future outside the dump. More children will be provided with uniforms, books and support to help them into school.

Over centuries, Wuzhou has served as a gateway city and regional transportation center to connect Guangxi with national and international markets, particularly through river transportation. In line with the Government?s development program, Wuzhou will be developed into a multimode regional transportation hub through domestically funded ongoing transportation projects. However, geological and geographic conditions constrain urban development in Wuzhou. The city is in a mountainous region divided into three parts by two big rivers. Because flat urban land is lacking, the residents tended to build their houses in the marginal lands, which were gradually expanding up the mountains along slopes of major valleys. The mountains in Wuzhou are mainly formed by loose earth, eroded granite, and clastic rocks. As such, they are vulnerable to rain-triggered geological disasters (known as geohazards) in the form of landslides, slope collapse, and mud and debris flows. Many of these valleys, though densely populated, have been classified as geohazard-prone zones.With support from the central Government, the Wuzhou municipal government (WMG) has made enormous investments to strengthen the control of geological disasters, mainly by building and rehabilitating of the slope protections and retaining walls. However, such traditional control measures have not always been economical and optimal solutions. Under severe weather conditions, these slope protections and retaining walls can be washed away together with houses and other buildings.The Guangxi Wuzhou Urban Development Project will adopt a new approach to address the geohazard concern of the city. The basic principle of this new approach to geohazard management is a shift from disaster rehabilitation to prevention. Under the Project, geological disasters are to be prevented through holistic urban planning and integrated public investment. The combination of these efforts will result in (i) carefully designed urban planning for long-term urban expansion, (ii) relocation of the people living in the geohazard-prone valley to the newly developed geohazard-free urban area, (iii) engineering measures for geohazard control to convert the evacuated geohazard-prone valley into geohazard-free land for urban redevelopment, and (iv) stronger geohazard forecasting and early warning capability to improve the effectiveness of the city?s geohazard management system.The Project is aimed at promoting sustainable urban development and improving quality of life in Wuzhou. The outcomes of the Project include improved environmental management through the enhanced disaster management and infrastructure and improved municipal services, particularly in the areas of wastewater management and solid waste management.",,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,3

El 60% de los pobres y el 83% de los indigentes viven en las áreas rurales (a pesar de que sólo constituyen la tercera parte de la población del país) y provienen mayoritariamente de poblaciones originarias de las etnias andinas y amazónicas. El problema identificado está relacionado con la precariedad de las viviendas de la población indígena. Las causas directas son las siguientes: 1. La autoconstrucción de las viviendas sin asistencia técnica que pone en riesgo la seguridad física y el confort de las personas generando mayor vulnerabilidad a riesgos geodinámicos, sismos y filtraciones de agua. 2.Las condiciones de insalubridad de las viviendas debido a las inadecuadas prácticas de higiene y limpieza asociadas al hacinamiento en el uso de los ambientes, la cohabitación de personas y animales menores, la escasa ventilación y asolamiento y los cambios bruscos de temperatura, que genera, sobre todo en niñas/os menores de 5 años, el incremento de infecciones respiratorias y digestivas, aumentando la desnutrición crónica infantil. 3.Los limitados ingresos económicos de las unidades familiares que impiden desarrollar inversiones para la mejora de las viviendas y pone en riesgo la seguridad alimentaria 4.Las limitadas capacidades en hombres y mujeres indígenas para generar propuestas en la demanda de vivienda digna ante las autoridades competentes. Con la implementación del proyecto se espera mejorar las condiciones de habitabilidad de las viviendas de la población indígena el desarrollo de sus capacidades y habilidades y la utilización tecnologías tradicionales mejoradas. Desde la tradicional organización comunal, se capacitará a las familias en la recuperación de prácticas ancestrales seguras, ecoeficientes y saludables con innovaciones sencillas que incorporen el uso de la energía solar, ventilación, servicios higiénicos y cocinas mejoradas. Asimismo, se apoyará a la familia (en particular a la mujer) en la instalación de infraestructura y equipamiento para la producción de cuyes separados de las personas lo que reducirá su mortalidad e incrementará la producción cárnica y reproductiva y los ingresos familiares que podrán ser destinados al mejoramiento en la vivienda. Finalmente, se promoverán espacios de concertación a través de distintos mecanismos institucionales de participación para generar y desarrollar acciones para la incidencia en las políticas públicas de acceso a una vivienda rural con dignidad. El enfoque estratégico de la intervención contempla diversos sistemas de capacitación para debatir y transferir habilidades e instrumentos para el mejoramiento de las condiciones de habitabilidad y salubridad de las familias de la Mancomunidad del Valle Sur de Cusco, y apuntará a disminuir las brechas de exclusión étnica cultural, socio económica y de género.",,2,1,2,,,,,0,0,1,0,0.0,0.0,3

EL QUICHÉ,Mejora de las condiciones de habitabilidad mediante la instalación de cocinas mejoradas a 800 familias indígenas en zonas rurales del Dpto. El Quiché,"Se dirige a mejorar las condiciones de habitabilidad de familias indígenas mediante la instalación de cocinas mejoradas, de forma que disminuyan los factores de riesgo para la salud por inhalación de humo, se tenga menor presión sobre el medioambiente y permitan optimizar las condiciones de trabajo y favorezcan la disponibilidad de tiempo a las mujeres. Para ello se realizará un trabajo en tres ejes: a) Instalación de cocinas mejoradas ahorradoras de leña. b) Capacitación del uso de la cocina, mantenimiento, higiene y medidas de salubridad. c) Reforestación con árboles de rápido crecimiento para la obtención de leña para consumo, asegurando un manejo sostenible del bosque, y capacitación en gestión ambiental. Se atenderá la problemática de que las familias indígenas cocinen en la única estancia del hogar, utilizando un sistema rudimentario (prácticamente una hoguera) lo que provoca humo que se concentra en el interior de la vivienda. Esta práctica acarrea importantes problemas a la familia y su entorno: produce patologías respiratorias y oculares sobre todo en mujeres y niños, que son quienes pasan más tiempo en el hogar, supone un consumo excesivo de leña que agrava los problemas de deforestación y el avance de la frontera agrícola, ocupa mucho tiempo y es un trabajo muy duro para las mujeres, y ha provocado graves accidentes caseros por quemaduras y abrasiones. El análisis técnico sobre los índices de morbilidad y deterioro ambiental, realizado por la Oficina Municipal de Planificación y las comisiones de Salud, Medio Ambiente y líderes comunitarios, permitió conocer de qué manera se ve afectada la población, el humo, es una de las causas más importantes de las enfermedades respiratorias y oculares. El proyecto se desarrollará en comunidades rurales del Dpto. de El Quiché (Guatemala), y es destinado a mejorar las condiciones de habitabilidad de 800 familias (2856 mujeres y 2744 hombres) en situación de pobreza y pobreza extrema, indígenas de la etnia Quiché, conformadas por un promedio de 7 personas. La mayoría son analfabetos/as o con nivel educativo muy bajo y no dimensionan los efectos en la salud de la inhalación prolongada de humo ni la presión que ejercen sobre el medio ambiente por el consumo indiscriminado de leña. Con el objetivo específico del mejoramiento de las condiciones de habitabilidad mediante la instalación de cocinas mejoradas, se pretende incidir en la calidad de vida de 800 familias indígenas de la zona rural, al actuar a través de tres ejes: Instalación de la cocina mejorada, Capacitación y Reforestación. Con todo ello se facilitará el trabajo a las mujeres, se mejorará su salud y la de sus hijos, y destinarán menor tiempo a la cocina y a la recogida de leña, todo ello influirá en la mejora de sus condiciones de vida.",,2,1,1,,,,,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,3

The SECO-financed Kyrgyz Housing Microfinance Project applies an innovative approach of how low-income residents can themselves on a  do-it-yourself  basis improve their homes. So-called Housing Microfinance Loans for these home improvements will be provided by banks or microfinance institutions. Kyrgyzstan is one of the poorest post-soviet countries. The majority of low-income residents live in single family houses, with low quality housing standars. In order to do these improvements, most residents need to take up a loan. However, since they neither have large savings nor regular income, banks often do not accept low-income clients and are reluctant to provide a loan. The objective of this project is therefore to develop a tailored Housing Microfinance lending product, which is linked to the provision of non-financial services, so that low-income residents can obtain financing for their basic home improvements.",,0,1,0,,,,,0,1,1,0,,,3

Related issues (Comic Relief): Sexual abuse or exploitation. Summary: It is estimated that around 20,000 young girls under the age of 18 are currently engaged in commercial sex work in Kampalas slums. Some are as young as 13. In many cases the girls have been trafficked from rural areas. Others end up in the trade as they see no other way of earning a living. The consequences are dire: high rates of HIV/AIDS, illegal abortions leading to increased mortality, substance abuse, mental health disorders and exposure to violence at the hands of clients or the police. Based on the learning from a successful and inspiring pilot project, this proposal will support girls and young women exploited in sex work to find ethical, meaningful and less risky alternatives to make a living. Through rehabilitation and vocational training, the project will help a total of 900 commercial sex workers develop the skills and confidence to find employment or start a business. Those who are mothers will receive extra support to take better care of their children. Access to integrated services will also improve sexual and reproductive health for around 25,000 particularly vulnerable slum dwellers. At the same time, initiatives will be taken to ensure both local communities and those in positions of authority understand the importance of protecting the rights of young women and girls forced into sex work and that appropriate laws and systems are in place to ensure that protection. The government of the UK (DfID) funded 50 percent of this grant - this share is excluded to avoid double counting in the DAC statistics.

The 2014 Ebola outbreak destroyed many lives and many people lost their jobs and sources of income. This project aims to help slum dwellers organise themselves. They will be assisted to document their living conditions, and the findings will help influence wider government policy on slums. These groups will be assisted to start savings schemes, and these will be used to help them start small businesses The project will also set up a Community Fund which will enable slum dwellers to make improvements in their houses and their living conditions. Big Lottery Fund funded 78 percent of this grant but the whole amount is attributed to Comic Relief as no double-counting occurs.

HIRD focuses on rural housing as an engine for economic transformation and accelerating rural development. Planned communities, modern house designs, new construction technology and materials, and more environmentally sustainable construction solutions are advancing the construction sector and providing opportunities for Uzbek entrepreneurs and industries. As part of HIRD up to 10,000 homes are being built per year, creating opportunities for up to 1,000 small rural contractors and 100,000 rural construction jobs annually. Improved access to nearby schools and clinics is a key part of this program. More reliable electricity, gas, and water supply, combined with community designs that include space for retail shops and commercial services, are opening up opportunities for home-based businesses. HIRD is an important driver for the 500,000 rural micro and small enterprises and home-based jobs targeted each year. On 31 August 2011, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved a $500 million multitranche financing facility (MFF) for the Housing for Integrated Rural Development (HIRD) Investment Program principally to provide financing to participating commercial banks (PCBs) for onlending to more than 40,000 targeted rural homebuyers.  Under HIRD, subloans financed by the MFF help support construction of new modern houses built in planned rural community sites, with serviced land plots with electricity, gas, water supply and sanitation, and roads provided by local governments. Local governments also provide access to and improvements in nearby schools and medical clinics, and are making space available for new retail shops and commercial services.",,1,,,,,,,,0,0,,,,3

Related issues (Comic Relief): Water and sanitation. Summary: Most people living in the peri-urban areas of Lusaka use a latrine for sanitation, often a covered pit latrine shared with a number of households. Many of these latrines are full because they cannot easily be emptied or relocated. When annual flooding occurs pits overflow leading to highly unsanitary conditions and a high incidence of disease and illness. This project has identified an innovative approach to faecal sludge management which addresses critical barriers in the sanitation chain the capture, transport, treatment and potential re-use of waste from pit latrines in a safe and sustainable way. As part of this pilot project, teams of pit latrine emptiers will be trained to ensure that waste is being safely transported and treated and awareness raising campaigns will take place in the communities to ensure there is an uptake of these improved services. The proposed project will seek to scale up the outreach and efficiency of the service being provided, further develop and test the way in which the service can be delivered better, and establish a basis for larger scale replication across informal settlements in Lusaka and other cities. This is an ambitious but exciting project which provides an opportunity to support the development and delivery of an important and basic service that could impact on many thousands of households living in Lusakas peri urban settlements. Learning from the project could also have relevance for interventions in other cities.

The SECO-financed Kyrgyz Housing Microfinance Project applies an innovative approach of how low-income residents can themselves on a  do-it-yourself  basis improve their homes. So-called Housing Microfinance Loans for these home improvements will be provided by banks or microfinance institutions. Kyrgyzstan is one of the poorest post-soviet countries. The majority of low-income residents live in single family houses, with low quality housing standars. In order to do these improvements, most residents need to take up a loan. However, since they neither have large savings nor regular income, banks often do not accept low-income clients and are reluctant to provide a loan. The objective of this project is therefore to develop a tailored Housing Microfinance lending product, which is linked to the provision of non-financial services, so that low-income residents can obtain financing for their basic home improvements.",,0,0,0,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,3

Related issues (Comic Relief): Water and sanitation. Summary: For years South Africa has struggled with a legacy of totally inadequate housing for the majority of the population. In 2012 the City of Cape Town built 7,000 new houses, but has an official waiting list of 400,000 families. Many of these people live in informal settlements where hundreds queue for water and toilets, there is little work or education, the majority of people may have HIV/AIDS and violence is endemic. Over the last six years an innovative urban planning project has been developed, placing people at the heart of upgrading their own communities and reducing crime at the same time. The approach encourages the people to make decisions on how community space is used and what services are needed, while also providing stimulus through education, sport and employment. The people themselves retain control of the improvements. Working with City officials, this project will now be rolled out into three new informal settlements with especially challenging histories of violence and deprivation. By integrating basic services like water and toilets with early childhood education, legal aid services (particularly for women), business start-up training and much more, the project will lead to long term gains and a model which can be replicated elsewhere. A particular feature of the project is to catalyse further investment from the municipality in the long term. The government of the UK (DfID) funded 50 percent of this grant - this share is excluded to avoid double counting in the DAC statistics.

Few people have access to toilets and many of these overflow as there is no emptying system in place. Also solid waste is rarely collected. This project will enable local community groups to take on contracts to empty toilets. They will also run publicity campaigns to make people more aware of the health risks of contaminated water. Water filters and latrines will be sold at low prices, and local people will be assisted to start up their own businesses to collect, recycle, and sell waste: the compost will then be used for producing flowers and vegetables.

By reducing energy and water use of buildings, operational costs for house owners will decrease. In many developing countries, the construction sector is booming and fast urbanization often leads to scarcity and thus higher prices for energy and water. Therefore, well-designed urban policies, particularly in the construction sector, can have huge economic, environmental and social impact.

None of the more than one hundred Kyrgyz Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) lends to low-income people for urgently needed home improvements. The major reason is that such lending is associated with specific risks that MFIs currently are not able to manage. Indeed, low-income earners require a different lending product from banks, as they neither have the savings to make a down-payment, nor do they have regular income which banks would accept. Hence, the goal of the Kyrgyz Housing Microfinance Project, to which the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs SECO has conributed 1 million CHF, is to develop a well targeted Housing Microfinance (HMF) Product to provide access to finance for home improvements and home extensions to low-income Kyrgyz households. It is expected that within 2 years after Project closure partner banks will have about 7% of their total loan portfolio in housing microfinance loans, i.e. USD 5 million in total.",,0,1,0,,,,,0,1,1,0,,0.0427,3

Related issues (Comic Relief): Land rights. Summary: Uganda is one of Africas most rapidly urbanizing countries, with as many as 3.5 million people living in slums today and estimated to reach 8 million by 2020. In Kampala, the new City Authority has published a proposed plan which could see the clearance and relocation of thousands of people from their homes in the slums, although proposals as to where they will move are far less clear. The need for sustainable housing solutions in Kampala becomes more critical by the month and many organisations continue to respond in different ways. But coordination and collaboration among stakeholders is poor, and there are currently few opportunities for organisations to share information or to develop collective responses to issues such as the need for eviction guidelines that protect the rights of slum dwellers and provide appropriate options for resettlement. This project will address these issues in two ways. First, it will help slum dwellers to establish housing cooperatives that will give them a stronger voice and improve access to land. Secondly, it will support development of an effective network for organisations working to improve the urban and slum environments, increasing access to key information and creating opportunities to participate in policy formation.

Summary: Over the last twenty years, living conditions for the majority of South Africas poor have hardly improved and for many have worsened. There remains a massive task to provide even the most basic of facilities. Comic Relief is proposing to support three organisations in Cape Town who are working to place the urban poor at the centre of changing their own lives. This has huge potential, but real progress will only be made if these organisations and other key players including the City of Cape Town, local businesses and the urban poor work and learn together. For these initial schemes to be scaled up, lessons and experiences gained from Cape Town need to be carefully recorded, analysed and shared. This project aims to provide the skills and opportunities to enable the three organisations to work together and with others. It will provide guidance as to where to focus, where and how to collect information. It will support the analysis of this information and how to share it with others to best effect. It will also identify where the work can influence policy and practice to scale up impact and significantly change large numbers of lives.

Related issues (Comic Relief): Water and sanitation. Summary: As many as two million people live in informal settlements in Kampala, with the slums of Central, Nakawa, and Kawempe Divisions regarded as the most vulnerable in terms of flood risk and levels of poverty. Although access to clean water and public latrines has been improving in some areas through government and NGO efforts, the majority of residents still lack access to decent affordable water supply and sanitation services. Three in every four illnesses are water borne or preventable, accounting for 17% of deaths in children under-five. Many schools lack even basic facilities let alone separate latrines allowing privacy and appropriate segregation for girls and boys. Building on a project already underway with funding from Comic Relief in Kawempe, WaterAid now plans to replicate this work in Central and Nakawa Divisions. The extension project will see construction of water catchment tanks and separate latrine facilities in 30 schools, benefiting a total of 24,000 children, especially girls. At the same time, public information and training programmes will increase hygiene understanding amongst school children and wider communities, promote the construction of household latrines and give a voice to slum dwellers as they hold local authorities to account and work to further improve living conditions. An extension of the current project for two more years in Kawempe will help ensure a legacy of improved health, living conditions and water and sanitation services across slums in three Divisions of Kampala.

So-called Housing Microfinance Loans for these home improvements will be provided by banks or microfinance institutions. Kyrgyzstan is one of the poorest post-soviet countries. The majority of low-income residents live in single family houses, with low quality housing standars. In order to do these improvements, most residents need to take up a loan. However, since they neither have large savings nor regular income, banks often do not accept low-income clients and are reluctant to provide a loan. The objective of this project is therefore to develop a tailored Housing Microfinance lending product, which is linked to the provision of non-financial services, so that low-income residents can obtain financing for their basic home improvements.",,0,1,0,,,,,0,1,1,0,,,3

The SECO-financed Kyrgyz Housing Microfinance Project applies an innovative approach of how low-income residents can themselves on a do-it-yourself basis improve their homes. So-called Housing Microfinance Loans for these home improvements will be provided by banks or microfinance institutions. Kyrgyzstan is one of the poorest post-soviet countries. The majority of low-income residents live in single family houses, with low quality housing standars. In order to do these improvements, most residents need to take up a loan. However, since they neither have large savings nor regular income, banks often do not accept low-income clients and are reluctant to provide a loan. The objective of this project is therefore to develop a tailored Housing Microfinance lending product, which is linked to the provision of non-financial services, so that low-income residents can obtain financing for their basic home improvements.",,0,1,0,,,,,0,1,1,0,,0.9353,3

Het militaire partnerschap met de Democratische Republiek Congo omvat vooral de vorming van, toezicht op en evaluatie van een 'URR' brigade (Unité de Réaction Rapide  - een soort paracommando's) bestaande uit drie elite bataljons (321e, 322e en 323e Bataillons de Réaction Rapide) te Kindu, naast de vorming, de begeleiding en evaluatie van de onderrichters van de Militaire Academie van Kananga en van de Genieschool in Likasi. Het 321e bataljon werd eind 2008-begin 2009 gevormd te Kananga, het 322e bataljon eind 2011-begin 2012 te Kindu en tenslotte het 323e bataljon in de loop van 2013 te Kindu. Blijft nog de vorming van de staf van de brigade die de drie gevormde elite bataljons zal omkaderen. Wanneer een militair in de Democratische Republiek Congo een standplaats krijgt toegewezen om er tijdelijk te verblijven, trekt zijn gezin bijna altijd mee. Deze verplaatsingen resulteren vaak in moeilijke levensomstandigheden voor de families. Die families dienen op zoek te gaan naar een onderkomen, naar gezondheidszorgen, naar een school voor hun kinderen en naar landbouwgrond om voedsel te kunnen produceren. Dit gebeurt vaak ten koste van de lokale populatie met conflicten als gevolg. Om aan deze tendens een halt toe te roepen, willen de Congolese regering en de Stafdienst van het leger (FARDC – Forces Armées de la République Démocratique du Congo) de militairen en hun gezin een vaste woonplaats bezorgen. Het is de bedoeling de militairen te huisvesten in garnizoensteden verspreid over het hele land. Zo zullen de militairen die op missie vertrekken, gerust gesteld zijn dat hun familie veilig en degelijk gehuisvest is.Kindu gelegen in de provincie Maniema is één van die garnizoensteden. De drie door België opgeleide bataljons worden gehuisvest te Kindu en omgeving, meer bepaald het 321e bataljon in het militaire kamp Lwama, het 322e bataljon in het militaire kamp Lokandu en het 323e bataljon in het militaire kamp Jericho.Nu bevonden deze militaire kampen zich in een lamentabele toestand wegens verwaarlozing ingevolge de oorlogen die de DRC de laatste jaren had gekend. De Belgische defensie in zijn partnerschapsakkoord met de DRC voorziet in de rehabilitatie van de infrastructuur van die kampen maar er waren onvoldoende fondsen voorzien voor de huisvesting van de militairen. Bijgevolg werd aan onze FOD Buitenlandse Zaken, Buitenlandse Handel en Ontwikkelingssamenwerking in het kader van een 3D benadering (défence, diplomatie et développement) gevraagd financieel bij te dragen voor de rehabilitatie van de huisvesting in deze kampen. In een eerste fase werd besloten het kamp Lwama te Kindu te rehabiliteren. GENERAL PURPOSE:  Contribuer à la consolidation de la sécurité avec le rétablissement de l'Autorité de l'Etat dans la partie EST de la RDC et dans la province du Maniema en particulier.SPECIFIC RESULTS:  Volet A: FAMIKI IIR1.

Summary: Over 90% of the population of Freetown live in slums, which are characterised by poor housing, overcrowding, poverty, unsanitary conditions and vulnerability to natural hazards. Over 60% of young people are unemployed and have little influence on the development of their communities. This project builds on a previous Y-Care International (YCI)/YMCA project in Freetown which enabled slum dwellers to access clean water, to develop new livelihood options, to access savings and loan services and to influence governments policy on slums. This follow on project will expand the work to another 6 slums in Freetown. There will be a focus on vocational training and enterprise development, life skills and literacy training, youth-led hygiene and health programmes, youth-led advocacy and community disaster preparedness and management planning. New water and toilet facilities will be installed and a small grants programme will be established for use by participating communities. YMCA will also support the further development of the Centre for Dialogue on Human Settlement and Poverty Alleviation (CODOHSAPA) and its work in carrying out community mapping and enumeration, establishing community savings and loan schemes and organising communities to take a lead role in their own development.

Related issues (Comic Relief): Lack of voice, influence, agency. Summary: Freetowns slums are amongst the most difficult places to survive let alone thrive - on earth. Faced with enormous challenges in providing shelter and services of any kind, there are many projects which attempt to improve living conditions. But they do so with little co-ordination or useful information on exactly the scale and extent of the problems. Through a new organisation linked to the University, this project will train and support people to bring existing and new information together on Freetowns slums with the aim of contributing to Freetowns first urban development plan. This could significant improve the quality and coordination of services in the slums, leading to slums dwellers being more secure, safe and better off. The government of the UK (DfID) funded 50 percent of this grant - this share is excluded to avoid double counting in the DAC statistics.

Although access to clean water and public latrines has been improving in some areas through government and NGO efforts, the majority of residents still lack access to decent affordable water supply and sanitation services. Three in every four illnesses are water borne or preventable, accounting for 17% of deaths in children under-five. Many schools lack even basic facilities let alone separate latrines allowing privacy and appropriate segregation for girls and boys. Building on a project already underway with funding from Comic Relief in Kawempe, WaterAid now plans to replicate this work in Central and Nakawa Divisions. The extension project will see construction of water catchment tanks and separate latrine facilities in 30 schools, benefiting a total of 24,000 children, especially girls. At the same time, public information and training programmes will increase hygiene understanding amongst school children and wider communities, promote the construction of household latrines and give a voice to slum dwellers as they hold local authorities to account and work to further improve living conditions. An extension of the current project for two more years in Kawempe will help ensure a legacy of improved health, living conditions and water and sanitation services across slums in three Divisions of Kampala. The government of the UK (DfID) funded 50 percent of this grant - this share is excluded to avoid double counting in the DAC statistics.

Women are often seen as the property of men, are taught to be submissive from a young age and are economically dependent. In Freetowns slums Sexual and Gender Based Violence (SGBV) including Female Genital Cutting (FGC), sexual exploitation and harassment, rape, unsafe sexual practices and commercial sex work are common occurrences. Discrimination, poverty, cultural norms, stigmatisation, insufficient knowledge and lack of respect for avenues of justice, contribute to the frequency of SGBV and perpetrators are rarely held accountable. There is a high level of tolerance for domestic violence and a recent study found that 63% of girls aged 15 19 believe it is acceptable for husbands to beat their wives. The proposed pilot project will be implemented in the eight most populated slums in Freetown and is aimed at addressing the root causes of SGBV. As a result of the project, girls, young women and their communities will have increased knowledge and awareness of their rights and the laws related to SGBV and Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH). There will be improved support services for victims of SGBV, as well as increased savings and wider opportunities for improved livelihoods and local community organisations will be better able to influence policy on issues of SGBV and SRH. The government of the UK (DfID) funded 50 percent of this grant - this share is excluded to avoid double counting in the DAC statistics.

So-called Housing Microfinance Loans for these home improvements will be provided by banks or microfinance institutions. Kyrgyzstan is one of the poorest post-soviet countries. The majority of low-income residents live in single family houses, with low quality housing standars. In order to do these improvements, most residents need to take up a loan. However, since they neither have large savings nor regular income, banks often do not accept low-income clients and are reluctant to provide a loan. The objective of this project is therefore to develop a tailored Housing Microfinance lending product, which is linked to the provision of non-financial services, so that low-income residents can obtain financing for their basic home improvements.",5;11.1,1,0,0,,0,0,,0,0,0,0,,,3

Related issues (Comic Relief): Water and sanitation. Summary: For years South Africa has struggled with a legacy of totally inadequate housing for the majority of the population. In 2012 the City of Cape Town built 7,000 new houses, but has an official waiting list of 400,000 families. Many of these people live in informal settlements where hundreds queue for water and toilets, there is little work or education, the majority of people may have HIV/AIDS and violence is endemic. Over the last six years an innovative urban planning project has been developed, placing people at the heart of upgrading their own communities and reducing crime at the same time. The approach encourages the people to make decisions on how community space is used and what services are needed, while also providing stimulus through education, sport and employment. The people themselves retain control of the improvements. Working with City officials, this project will now be rolled out into three new informal settlements with especially challenging histories of violence and deprivation. By integrating basic services like water and toilets with early childhood education, legal aid services (particularly for women), business start-up training and much more, the project will lead to long term gains and a model which can be replicated elsewhere. A particular feature of the project is to catalyse further investment from the municipality in the long term. The government of the UK (DfID) funded 50 percent of this grant - this share is excluded to avoid double counting in the DAC statistics. Full grant commitment: GBP 3257.22 thousand.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3

BURKINA FASO.,OWN PROGRAMME: SCHOLARSHIP FOR DEGREE FINAL PROJECT. Burkina Faso.,"A lo largo del proyecto ha habido muchos cambios debido a las condiciones en las que nos encontrábamos. Inicialmente planteé tres objetivos: 1.Realizar un estudio documental de tipo de vivienda tradicional de Baasnéré, Burkina Faso. 2.Participar en la ejecución del proyecto de La escuela de secundaria de Baasnéré, con la ayuda de Algemesí Solidari y A3B3.Aplicar los conocimientos adquiridos en el proyecto de La biblioteca del Raval situado en Algemesí. Todos han sido tratados, unos en mayor medida que otros, pero han sido analizados. Una de las cosas que he aprendido allí es que tus planes pueden cambiar constantemente ya que la climatología y la forma de vida que se lleva condiciona mucho el trabajo y como plantear las cosas. Debido a estos aspectos, me he centrado más en el proyecto constructivo que en el análisis de las viviendas, la supervisión de la obra requería más horas de las que pensábamos, aún así, todo el proceso con los BTC ha sido ventajoso para el futuro desarrollo de documentación de la vivienda tradicional. Por una parte el sistema constructivo de la escuela es similar al autóctono y por otra parte, el equipo de obreros, habitantes de Baasnéré, conocía la técnica y había realizado pequeñas obras en el poblado Burkinés. El proyecto de la biblioteca del Raval empieza a desarrollarse ahora, tanto en el ámbito de diseño como en el ámbito material. Espero poder aportar todos mis conocimientos adquiridos en Baasnéré para facilitar y mejorar la futura obraEl principal objetivo del proyecto es realizar una investigación antropológica y arquitectónica quepermitan documentar la historia y evolución de la arquitectura de Baasneere.La población se organiza aparentemente de manera aleatoria, pero sobretodo alrededor de la zonade mercado, punto de encuentro principal. La arquitectura se caracteriza por la utilización demateriales como el mijo y la tierra, dos materiales autóctonos y fáciles de encontrar en la zona.El resultado son pequeñas construcciones cilíndricas con un uso exclusivo de vivienda yalmacenamiento realizados con adobe de tierra cruda y cubiertas cónicas hechas con paja decereales que ellos mismos cultivan (mijo en el caso de Baasneere). Para delimitar el espaciodoméstico se construyen unos muros de adobe que recorren los diferentes edificios, generandouna estructura de patios mas o menos compleja.",,2,2,2,0,,,,1,1,1,1,0.0025,0.0,1

In many developing countries, the construction sector is booming and fast urbanization often leads to scarcity and thus higher prices for energy and water. Therefore, well-designed urban policies, particularly in the construction sector, can have huge economic, environmental and social impact.

En esta cuarta fase de la intervención se tratará de dar respuesta a esta situación continuando con el trabajo en la región. Así, el objetivo del proyecto es la mejora de las condiciones de acceso a un hábitat domiciliar saludable de la población más vulnerable del departamento de Retalhueu, Guatemala, con énfasis en las mujeres viudas o solteras, a través de un proceso colaborativo entre comunidades, autoridades municipales, organizaciones sociales y cooperativas. Se plantean tres líneas de intervención a lo largo de las dos anualidades presentadas que se complementarán con un adecuado sistema de seguimiento y evaluación del proyecto: 1- Fortalecimiento institucional y comunitario: Como parte del seguimiento al proceso de formación y acompañamiento a las comunidades de Champerico y a las autoridades comunitarias y locales, se busca reforzar y capacitar sobre Producción Social de Vivienda y Hábitat –PSVHA-. Se realizará un Diplomado con los contenidos de esta temática en donde participarán integrantes del Consejo de Autoridades Comunitarias del Sur y Representantes Comunitarios integrantes del COMUDE (Consejo Municipal de Desarrollo) con el objeto de fortalecer la organización comunitaria y la institucionalidad para que a través del conocimiento de la Producción Social de Vivienda y Hábitat puedan promover iniciativas que contribuyan a la mejora del hábitat de las familias de las comunidades de Champerico. 2- Mejora de las condiciones de acceso a un hábitat saludable de 18 familias en condiciones de alta vulnerabilidad mediante la construcción de vivienda: Para dar continuidad a lógica y filosofía de las intervenciones de ASF (Ver anexo 6: Proyectos en colaboración) se generarán dinámicas en torno a la construcción para el fomento del desarrollo autónomo local. En este sentido se fortalecerán las estructuras locales, se contratará a albañiles y profesionales de las comunidades y se involucra las propias familias en el trabajo, además de emplear materiales de la cooperativa B'eljujQ'anil, una iniciativa de producción local con fines sociales. 3- Mejora de hábitos higiénicos y hábitat domiciliar: Se trata de promover prácticas sencillas de limpieza, manejo de los residuos, agua y alimentos etc… que reduzcan los riesgos de contraer las principales enfermedades que afectan estas poblaciones, así como de sentar las bases d",,1,1,1,0,,,,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.1733,1

The SECO-financed Kyrgyz Housing Microfinance Project applies an innovative approach of how low-income residents can themselves on a  do-it-yourself  basis improve their homes. So-called Housing Microfinance Loans for these home improvements will be provided by banks or microfinance institutions. Kyrgyzstan is one of the poorest post-soviet countries. The majority of low-income residents live in single family houses, with low quality housing standars. In order to do these improvements, most residents need to take up a loan. However, since they neither have large savings nor regular income, banks often do not accept low-income clients and are reluctant to provide a loan. The objective of this project is therefore to develop a tailored Housing Microfinance lending product, which is linked to the provision of non-financial services, so that low-income residents can obtain financing for their basic home improvements.",,0,0,0,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,3

Queda justificada de manera concisa la necesidad  del proyecto, ya que, tal y como se describe en los antecedentes, la población del distrito de Anantapur está situada en la zona más seca del país, en ella residen en su mayoría campesinos sin tierra, cuya única fuente de ingresos proviene de la agricultura y concretamente, del cacahuete y  depende de los ciclos de lluvia. Los campesinos emigran a otras áreas para sobrevivir, desintegrando las familias, la comunidad, el abandono de la educación. Por otro lado, la falta de recursos provoca falta de alimentos y malnutrición.El objetivo último de la ONGD es el desarrollo comunitario, por ello la construcción de viviendas, evitará la migración de las personas de la aldea, haciéndoles partícipes de la comunidad al tener ya una propiedad. Siendo la mujer la responsable de ésta se  favorecerá su empoderamiento dentro de una sociedad donde el hombre tiene la última palabra. Con la construcción de las 49 viviendas con saneamiento, cuya titular será la mujer, se pretende frenar la emigración, creando núcleos estables y promoviendo así el tejido asociativo de la aldea. Con la creación de centros comunitarios podrán llevarse a cabo nuevos proyectos de desarrollo económico y social.Al incorporar saneamiento en las viviendas se evitarán enfermedades como el cólera, malaria, diarrea provocadas por la falta de higiene. El proyecto actuaría sobre dos problemas diferentes y complementarios, por un lado la falta de acceso al derecho a una vivienda digna y por otro al derecho del agua y saneamiento.Las personas beneficiarias directas del proyecto son 49 personas y sus familias de la comunidad de Venkatampalli, 47 mujeres y 2 hombres monoparentales. Viven bajo el umbral de la pobreza en zonas rurales y pertenecen a las castas más bajas de la estructura de la sociedad India. El proyecto se centra en las mujeres de las zonas rurales, de las 49 personas beneficiarias, 47 son mujeres, casadas en su mayoría menores de 38 años y 2 hombres viudos de 40 años de edad. Más de la mitad de las mujeres son analfabetas, cuya actividad económica principal son labores agrícolas.El proyecto beneficiará indirectamente a 342 personas habitantes de la aldea, que sobre todo se beneficiaran desde el punto de vista de la salud pública al reducirse la contaminación microbiológica sobre las fuentes de agua que implica la defecación al aire libre. Los nuevos propietarios se involucrarán más con los vecinos y la comunidad, siendo beneficioso para ambos.",,2,1,1,0,,,,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0061,1

Concretamente el proyecto planteado se desarrollará en el Batey La Balsa, se pretende mejorar las condiciones de habitabilidad básica y de las condiciones de salud y de vida de las personas del Batey La Balsa, mediante la erradicación de los barracones y vivienda precaria y desarrollando acciones orientadas al fortalecimiento de la atención a la salud comunitaria y a una vida libre de violencia para las mujeres y niñas.El Instituto de Acción Comunitaria (IDAC) y ACPP, y más recientemente con el apoyo de AGARESO, plantean 3 ejes fundamentales de actuación consistentes en:1. Garantizar el acceso a una vivienda digna y saludable a 44 personas (27 son mujeres y 17 hombres) a través de la construcción y entrega a 8 familias de 4 bloques de viviendas adosadas (llamadas viviendas dúplex) con una fosa séptica con capacidad para 15 viviendas. Para el buen uso y mantenimiento de las mismas se constituirá y formará un Comité de Construcción que coordinará la mano de obra voluntaria y apoyará en las tareas de construcción.2. Fortalecer las capacidades, tanto formativas como de equipamientos, del sistema comunitario de salud del Batey La Balsa en temas de salud comunitaria, prevención de violencia contra las mujeres y derechos sexuales y reproductivos. Para ello se llevarán a cabo sesiones de refuerzo con las 15 promotoras que conforman la Rede de Salud Comunitaria del Batey. Este refuerzo se ha diseñado conjuntamente con la Dirección Provincial de Salud y el Ministerio de la Mujer desde un enfoque de género con el objetivo de mejorar la calidad de vida de las mujeres y niñas del Batey para incidir en problemas de violencia en todas sus manifestaciones. Además, se complementará el equipamiento del Hogar Comunitaria y Salud y se trabajará con las mujeres del Batey en cuestiones relacionadas con la autoestima y los derechos sexuales y reproductivos. 3. Promover una cultura de la igualdad y equidad de género. Se llevarán a cabo talleres en centros educativos para la promoción de una vida sin violencia. Se llevarán a cabo en colaboración con los Ministerios de Educación y de la Mujer con los que se han firmado convenios de colaboración.

En este sentido, se han construido más de 64.000 viviendas para la población rural de Anantapur. Además, con el presente proyecto se busca ir un paso más adelante y trabajar también en el derecho al saneamiento, por medio de la construcción de baños con letrinas adecuados a las necesidades de la población local, lo cual tendrá consecuencias muy importantes sobre la salud de la población, especialmente para los niños y las niñas, y la seguridad de las mujeres. Para ello se construirán 16 viviendas dignas en la comunidad rural de D. Cherlopalli,  asegurando que la propiedad quede en manos de las mujeres cabeza de familia, con el fin de promover el empoderamiento social de las mismas. Las mujeres y sus familias viven ahora en chozas deterioradas, poco salubres e inseguras, que perpetúan su situación de vulnerabilidad y exclusión, especialmente de las mujeres, empeorada por la inseguridad que conlleva la defecación e higiene personal al aire libre. Este proyecto es el resultado del trabajo entre el Panchayat (gobierno local), el Comité de Desarrollo Comunitario (CDC), la población meta y la contraparte local. Para ello, atendiendo a la solicitud de las comunidad de Meerjapuram a través de sus representantes en el CDC, se plantea hacer efectivo su derecho a una vivienda digna, proporcionándoles los recursos humanos, técnicos y materiales necesarios para la construcción de viviendas, de forma que sus miembros participen en los trabajos de gestión y construcción en la medida de sus posibilidades. Con la realización de este proyecto, se habrá conseguido facilitar el acceso a una vivienda digna con saneamiento básico a las mujeres y personas con discapacidad y sus familias, a través de los siguientes resultados:R1. Habilitado el derecho de una vivienda digna y permanente a 66 personas  de los colectivos más desfavorecidos de la aldea de Meerjapuram  en condiciones óptimas de salubridadR2. Habilitado el acceso al derecho a un saneamiento básico a través de la construcción de 16 baños con pozo de filtraciónR3.

Related issues (Comic Relief): Sexual abuse or exploitation. Summary: Cultural norms within Sierra Leone influence the unequal relationship between women and men. Women are often seen as the property of men, are taught to be submissive from a young age and are economically dependent. In Freetowns slums Sexual and Gender Based Violence (SGBV) including Female Genital Cutting (FGC), sexual exploitation and harassment, rape, unsafe sexual practices and commercial sex work are common occurrences. Discrimination, poverty, cultural norms, stigmatisation, insufficient knowledge and lack of respect for avenues of justice, contribute to the frequency of SGBV and perpetrators are rarely held accountable. There is a high level of tolerance for domestic violence and a recent study found that 63% of girls aged 15 19 believe it is acceptable for husbands to beat their wives. The proposed pilot project will be implemented in the eight most populated slums in Freetown and is aimed at addressing the root causes of SGBV. As a result of the project, girls, young women and their communities will have increased knowledge and awareness of their rights and the laws related to SGBV and Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH). There will be improved support services for victims of SGBV, as well as increased savings and wider opportunities for improved livelihoods and local community organisations will be better able to influence policy on issues of SGBV and SRH. The government of the UK (DfID) funded 50 percent of this grant - this share is excluded to avoid double counting in the DAC statistics.

By reducing energy and water use of buildings, operational costs for house owners will decrease. In many developing countries, the construction sector is booming and fast urbanization often leads to scarcity and thus higher prices for energy and water. Therefore, well-designed urban policies, particularly in the construction sector, can have huge economic, environmental and social impact.

None of the more than one hundred Kyrgyz Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) lends to low-income people for urgently needed home improvements. The major reason is that such lending is associated with specific risks that MFIs currently are not able to manage. Indeed, low-income earners require a different lending product from banks, as they neither have the savings to make a down-payment, nor do they have regular income which banks would accept. Hence, the goal of the Kyrgyz Housing Microfinance Project, to which the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs SECO has conributed 1 million CHF, is to develop a well targeted Housing Microfinance (HMF) Product to provide access to finance for home improvements and home extensions to low-income Kyrgyz households. It is expected that within 2 years after Project closure partner banks will have about 7% of their total loan portfolio in housing microfinance loans, i.e. USD 5 million in total.",,0,0,0,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,3

Related issues (Comic Relief): Water and sanitation. Summary: Until recently most of the population of Malawi lived in rural areas, but Malawi now has one of the most rapid rates of urbanisation in the world. Two-thirds of the urban population, over 1.7 million people, live in informal settlements. Here they face multiple challenges severe overcrowding, constant threats of eviction, very poor housing conditions and little access to safe drinking water and sanitation. Over the last few years Comic Relief has been supporting what has become a national movement of slum dwellers to improve both their living conditions and their livelihoods. Previous grants have helped settlement residents across Malawi access affordable finance for house construction, small enterprises, and improved water supply and sanitation. They have also been able to advocate for more land to be made available, and for greater security of tenure. There are signs that urban policies are changing. Comic Relief is being asked to continue its support for a further five years, building on the lessons learned to date, and giving greater emphasis to helping settlement residents access more land and improve existing conditions. A concerted effort over this longer time period will lead to gains in quality of life and more urban poor-friendly policies at a national level.

Related issues (Comic Relief): Water and sanitation. Summary: Freetown slums are in a deplorable state with many areas devoid of piped water and any form of improved sanitation. Most houses are made of temporary building materials and settlements are vulnerable to flooding. Cholera is a recurrent hazard. Comic Relief funded a previous slum project (2008 2012) supporting communities in three slums to improve their quality of life. However, the need to make additional improvements within these settlements and to help others, still exists. This follow-on project intends to support young people, petty traders (particularly women) and other disadvantaged people living in 8 slums in Freetown. The project will provide vocational training and apprenticeships, affordable micro-credit loans and improvement of literacy, business and money management skills. It will also improve access to basic services, including water and improved drainage and provide hygiene training. The capacity of local community based organisations (CBOs) will be strengthened and support provided to improve advocacy skills, enhancing their ability to hold government to account. As a result there will be a healthier environment and increased incomes, especially for women, young people and other marginalised groups, leading to a better quality of life in the slums. In addition the project will promote advocacy relating to streamlining of land tenure systems and seek to influence planning and national housing policy.

It supports the implementation of five model co-operatives in the housing and agri-food sectors. By the end of the project, the five entrepreneurial model co-operatives are expected to continue growing autonomously and reach even more households in their respective economic sectors.The project aims to build the skills and capacities of men and women, foster climate-smart economic activities, and facilitate access to funding for co-operatives. The project will therefore increase social and economic opportunities for women by enhancing their economic power. Women leaders play a key role in the project.Project activities include 1) training and capacity building for participants (co-operative members, co operative leaders, elected officials and managers), 2) acquiring and installing community infrastructure, technology and facilities to meet environmental challenges arising from climate change, 3) activities that are specifically aimed at women, including leadership training and mentoring for women, 4) developing a training program for elected officials and co operative leader members on the importance of women's active participation in decision-making bodies. / Le projet appuie la croissance inclusive et verte en Côte d'Ivoire, au Sénégal et au Ghana en renforçant les coopératives, avec une emphase particulière sur les populations vulnérables et les femmes.

Ainsi, le projet permet d'accroître les opportunités économiques et sociales pour les femmes en renforçant leur pouvoir économique.

In 2012 the City of Cape Town built 7,000 new houses, but has an official waiting list of 400,000 families. Many of these people live in informal settlements where hundreds queue for water and toilets, there is little work or education, the majority of people may have HIV/AIDS and violence is endemic. Over the last six years an innovative urban planning project has been developed, placing people at the heart of upgrading their own communities and reducing crime at the same time. The approach encourages the people to make decisions on how community space is used and what services are needed, while also providing stimulus through education, sport and employment. The people themselves retain control of the improvements. Working with City officials, this project will now be rolled out into three new informal settlements with especially challenging histories of violence and deprivation. By integrating basic services like water and toilets with early childhood education, legal aid services (particularly for women), business start-up training and much more, the project will lead to long term gains and a model which can be replicated elsewhere. A particular feature of the project is to catalyse further investment from the municipality in the long term.

It supports the implementation of five model co-operatives in the housing and agri-food sectors. By the end of the project, the five entrepreneurial model co-operatives are expected to continue growing autonomously and reach even more households in their respective economic sectors.The project aims to build the skills and capacities of men and women, foster climate-smart economic activities, and facilitate access to funding for co-operatives. The project will therefore increase social and economic opportunities for women by enhancing their economic power. Women leaders play a key role in the project.Project activities include 1) training and capacity building for participants (co-operative members, co operative leaders, elected officials and managers), 2) acquiring and installing community infrastructure, technology and facilities to meet environmental challenges arising from climate change, 3) activities that are specifically aimed at women, including leadership training and mentoring for women, 4) developing a training program for elected officials and co operative leader members on the importance of women's active participation in decision-making bodies. / Le projet appuie la croissance inclusive et verte en Côte d'Ivoire, au Sénégal et au Ghana en renforçant les coopératives, avec une emphase particulière sur les populations vulnérables et les femmes.

On s'attend à ce qu'à la fin du projet, les cinq modèles entrepreneuriaux coopératifs puissent continuer à croître de manière autonome et atteindre encore plus de ménages dans leur secteur économique respectif.Le projet cherche à renforcer les capacités et les compétences des femmes et des hommes, à favoriser des activités économiques climato-intelligentes et à faciliter l'accès au financement pour les coopératives. Ainsi, le projet permet d'accroître les opportunités économiques et sociales pour les femmes en renforçant leur pouvoir économique. Les femmes leaders jouent un rôle clé dans le projet.Les activités du projet comprennent : 1) la formation et le renforcement des capacités des participants (membres des coopératives, membres leaders des coopératives, personnes élues et gestionnaires), 2) l'acquisition et installation des infrastructures, technologies et équipements collectifs pour  répondre aux défis environnementaux découlant des changements climatiques, 3) des activités visant spécifiquement les femmes, incluant des formations en leadership et du mentorat pour les femmes, 4) mettre sur pied un programme de formation pour les personnes élues et les membres leaders des coopératives sur l'importance d'une participation active des femmes dans les instances décisionnelles.",13,1,2,2,,,,0,0,1,1,0,0.0,0.3741,1

In the capital city Kampala it is estimated that more than 1.5 million people now live in slums, mostly located in overcrowded, flood-prone areas of the city. While the new Kampala Capital City Authority is taking steps to develop a more structured approach to this rapid urban growth, it has limited knowledge or detailed information on the 50 or more different slums in the city. At the same time, slum dwellers in Kampala continue to voice frustration at the lack of opportunities to engage with government and help shape the communities in which they live. This project will help Kampalas slum dwellers to organise themselves so that they can meaningfully participate in urban governance and development. Access to small loans and training will build livelihood opportunities and encourage saving and active citizenship. Data collected by slum dwellers will enable effective planning for upgrading informal settlements in partnership with government, while loan funds for improvements to basic services such as water and sanitation will begin to have a transformative effect on the living conditions for slum dwellers across all of Kampalas five districts. The government of the UK (DfID) funded 50 percent of this grant - this share is excluded to avoid double counting in the DAC statistics.

There remains a massive task to provide even the most basic of facilities. Comic Relief is proposing to support three organisations in Cape Town who are working to place the urban poor at the centre of changing their own lives. This has huge potential, but real progress will only be made if these organisations and other key players including the City of Cape Town, local businesses and the urban poor work and learn together. For these initial schemes to be scaled up, lessons and experiences gained from Cape Town need to be carefully recorded, analysed and shared. This project aims to provide the skills and opportunities to enable the three organisations to work together and with others. It will provide guidance as to where to focus, where and how to collect information. It will support the analysis of this information and how to share it with others to best effect. It will also identify where the work can influence policy and practice to scale up impact and significantly change large numbers of lives. The government of the UK (DfID) funded 50 percent of this grant - this share is excluded to avoid double counting in the DAC statistics.

Most houses are made of temporary building materials and settlements are vulnerable to flooding. Cholera is a recurrent hazard. Comic Relief funded a previous slum project (2008 2012) supporting communities in three slums to improve their quality of life. However, the need to make additional improvements within these settlements and to help others, still exists. This follow-on project intends to support young people, petty traders (particularly women) and other disadvantaged people living in 8 slums in Freetown. The project will provide vocational training and apprenticeships, affordable micro-credit loans and improvement of literacy, business and money management skills. It will also improve access to basic services, including water and improved drainage and provide hygiene training. The capacity of local community based organisations (CBOs) will be strengthened and support provided to improve advocacy skills, enhancing their ability to hold government to account. As a result there will be a healthier environment and increased incomes, especially for women, young people and other marginalised groups, leading to a better quality of life in the slums. In addition the project will promote advocacy relating to streamlining of land tenure systems and seek to influence planning and national housing policy. The government of the UK (DfID) funded 50 percent of this grant - this share is excluded to avoid double counting in the DAC statistics.

The SECO-financed Kyrgyz Housing Microfinance Project applies an innovative approach of how low-income residents can themselves on a do-it-yourself basis improve their homes. So-called Housing Microfinance Loans for these home improvements will be provided by banks or microfinance institutions. Kyrgyzstan is one of the poorest post-soviet countries. The majority of low-income residents live in single family houses, with low quality housing standars. In order to do these improvements, most residents need to take up a loan. However, since they neither have large savings nor regular income, banks often do not accept low-income clients and are reluctant to provide a loan. The objective of this project is therefore to develop a tailored Housing Microfinance lending product, which is linked to the provision of non-financial services, so that low-income residents can obtain financing for their basic home improvements.",13;11.1,0,1,0,,0,0,,0,1,1,0,,,3

This project will enable local community groups to take on contracts to empty toilets. They will also run publicity campaigns to make people more aware of the health risks of contaminated water. Water filters and latrines will be sold at low prices, and local people will be assisted to start up their own businesses to collect, recycle, and sell waste: the compost will then be used for producing flowers and vegetables.

Related issues (Comic Relief): Water and sanitation. Summary: Most people living in the peri-urban areas of Lusaka use a latrine for sanitation, often a covered pit latrine shared with a number of households. Many of these latrines are full because they cannot easily be emptied or relocated. When annual flooding occurs pits overflow leading to highly unsanitary conditions and a high incidence of disease and illness. This project has identified an innovative approach to faecal sludge management which addresses critical barriers in the sanitation chain the capture, transport, treatment and potential re-use of waste from pit latrines in a safe and sustainable way. As part of this pilot project, teams of pit latrine emptiers will be trained to ensure that waste is being safely transported and treated and awareness raising campaigns will take place in the communities to ensure there is an uptake of these improved services. The proposed project will seek to scale up the outreach and efficiency of the service being provided, further develop and test the way in which the service can be delivered better, and establish a basis for larger scale replication across informal settlements in Lusaka and other cities. This is an ambitious but exciting project which provides an opportunity to support the development and delivery of an important and basic service that could impact on many thousands of households living in Lusakas peri urban settlements. Learning from the project could also have relevance for interventions in other cities. The government of the UK (DfID) funded 50 percent of this grant - this share is excluded to avoid double counting in the DAC statistics. Full grant commitment: GBP 750 thousand.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3

La India. :: El presente proyecto se desarrolla en la comunidad rural D. Cherlopalli (384 familias / 1.296 habitantes), Región de Bathalapalli, del distrito de Anantapur, en el estado de Andhra Pradesh (46,7 millones hab.), al sudeste del país. Desde el año 1996, la construcción de viviendas es uno de los sectores principales en los que interviene la Fundación Vicente Ferrer, entendiendo el derecho a la vivienda como un derecho universal. En este sentido, se han construido mas de 61.000 viviendas para la población rural de Anantapur. Además, con el presente proyecto se busca ir un paso más adelante y trabajar también en el derecho al saneamiento, por medio de la construcción de baños con letrinas adecuados a las necesidades de la población local, lo cual tendrá consecuencias muy importantes sobre la salud de la población, especialmente para los niños y las niñas, y la seguridad de las mujeres. Para ello se construirán 54 viviendas dignas en la comunidad rural de D. Cherlopalli, asegurando que la propiedad queda en manos de las mujeres cabeza de familia, con el fin de promover el empoderamiento social de las mismas.Las mujeres y sus familias viven ahora en chozas deterioradas, poco salubres e inseguras, que perpetúan su situación de vulnerabilidad y exclusión, especialmente de las mujeres, empeorada por la inseguridad que conlleva la defecación e higiene personal al aire libre.Este proyecto es el resultado del trabajo entre el Panchayat (gobierno local), el Comité de Desarrollo Comunitario (CDC), la población meta y la contraparte local. Para ello, atendiendo a la solicitud de la comunidad D. Cherlopalli, se plantea hacer efectivo su derecho a una vivienda digna, proporcionándoles los recursos humanos, técnicos y materiales necesarios para la construcción de viviendas, de forma que sus miembros participen en los trabajos de gestión y construcción en la medida de sus posibilidades. Con la realización de este proyecto, se habrá conseguido facilitar el acceso a una vivienda digna con saneamiento básico a 54 mujeres y sus familias (233 personas). Los resultados esperados y las actividades para alcanzarlos, son:RE1. Promovido el derecho a una vivienda digna, permanente y segura a 54 mujeres y sus familias en la comunidad rural de D. Cherlopalli: 1.1. Estudios y preparación de planos técnicos, preparación de terrenos y obtención de licencias. 1.2. Identificación de proveedores de materiales y suministros. 1.3. Compra y transporte de materiales y suministros. 1.4. Valoración técnica de las familias beneficiarias. 1.5.

It supports the implementation of five model co-operatives in the housing and agri-food sectors. By the end of the project, the five entrepreneurial model co-operatives are expected to continue growing autonomously and reach even more households in their respective economic sectors.  The project aims to build the skills and capacities of men and women, foster climate-smart economic activities, and facilitate access to funding for co-operatives. The project will therefore increase social and economic opportunities for women by enhancing their economic power. Women leaders play a key role in the project.  Project activities include 1) training and capacity building for participants (co-operative members, co operative leaders, elected officials and managers), 2) acquiring and installing community infrastructure, technology and facilities to meet environmental challenges arising from climate change, 3) activities that are specifically aimed at women, including leadership training and mentoring for women, 4) developing a training program for elected officials and co operative leader members on the importance of women's active participation in decision-making bodies. / Le projet appuie la croissance inclusive et verte en Côte d'Ivoire, au Sénégal et au Ghana en renforçant les coopératives, avec une emphase particulière sur les populations vulnérables et les femmes.

On s'attend à ce qu'à la fin du projet, les cinq modèles entrepreneuriaux coopératifs puissent continuer à croître de manière autonome et atteindre encore plus de ménages dans leur secteur économique respectif.  Le projet cherche à renforcer les capacités et les compétences des femmes et des hommes, à favoriser des activités économiques climato-intelligentes et à faciliter l'accès au financement pour les coopératives. Ainsi, le projet permet d'accroître les opportunités économiques et sociales pour les femmes en renforçant leur pouvoir économique. Les femmes leaders jouent un rôle clé dans le projet.  Les activités du projet comprennent : 1) la formation et le renforcement des capacités des participants (membres des coopératives, membres leaders des coopératives, personnes élues et gestionnaires), 2) l'acquisition et installation des infrastructures, technologies et équipements collectifs pour  répondre aux défis environnementaux découlant des changements climatiques, 3) des activités visant spécifiquement les femmes, incluant des formations en leadership et du mentorat pour les femmes, 4) mettre sur pied un programme de formation pour les personnes élues et les membres leaders des coopératives sur l'importance d'une participation active des femmes dans les instances décisionnelles.",9;2;11,1,2,2,0,,1,0,0,1,1,0,,,3

Two-thirds of the urban population, over 1.7 million people, live in informal settlements. Here they face multiple challenges severe overcrowding, constant threats of eviction, very poor housing conditions and little access to safe drinking water and sanitation. Over the last few years Comic Relief has been supporting what has become a national movement of slum dwellers to improve both their living conditions and their livelihoods. Previous grants have helped settlement residents across Malawi access affordable finance for house construction, small enterprises, and improved water supply and sanitation. They have also been able to advocate for more land to be made available, and for greater security of tenure. There are signs that urban policies are changing. Comic Relief is being asked to continue its support for a further five years, building on the lessons learned to date, and giving greater emphasis to helping settlement residents access more land and improve existing conditions. A concerted effort over this longer time period will lead to gains in quality of life and more urban poor-friendly policies at a national level.

Fase 6 (cierre).El presente proyecto constituye la fase sexta y de cierre del Programa de hábitat domiciliar Ban Chuinklal, desarrollado desde el año 2014 hasta la actualidad (6 años) por las organizaciones consorciadas en el proyecto: Arquitectura Sin Fronteras, ASIAPRODI y FODHAP, y que, a su vez, ha dado continuidad a la línea de habitabilidad básica del Programa de Desarrollo Integral (IDI) Oxlajuj Tz'ikin, promovido por la Cooperación Gallega en los municipios de Champerico y Retalhuleu entre los años 2008 y 2012. Como se ha mencionado, se trata de un proyecto de cierre dentro del programa Ban Chuinklal. Este cierre no está provocado por la superación de los déficits educativos en la región, sino que se considera necesario dar apertura a un espacio de reflexión y de rediseño de la estrategia de trabajo en el departamento. Por un lado, después de seis años de intervención, el proyecto ha logrado y promovido cambios positivos en las comunidades, por otro, el contexto general centroamericano, de Guatemala, de la región y de la cooperación internacional han cambiado, por todo esto se hace necesario un análisis de lo realizado y valorar una reorientación en la estrategia de trabajo. En este sentido ya se ha abierto un proceso, que continuará a lo largo de este año, con titulares de derechos, responsabilidades y obligaciones, con el objetivo de establecer un nuevo enfoque para el abordaje de los déficits habitacionales de todas las comunidades con un enfoque más amplio y que responda mejor a las condiciones y demandas de la población. Como proyecto de cierre, se ha puesto especial atención en la incorporación, en los diferentes resultados, de acciones orientadas, en primer lugar, a la transferencia de capacidades a titulares de obligaciones, responsabilidades y derechos, y, por otro lado, a la evaluación y sistematización de la experiencia del programa. El objetivo sería, como se ha dicho, aprovechar los aprendizajes para un nuevo reenfoque de las acciones o para el traslado de la experiencia a otras regiones de Guatemala. Con respecto al contenido de la intervención del presente proyecto, se ha tratado de recoger los aprendizajes de etapas anteriores, fruto de la reflexión interna del equipo y de la visión externa de las evaluaciones anteriores, definiendo una nueva intervención en materia de hábitat domiciliar con un carácter más integral. El proyecto se estructura en 4 resultados, el primero y el tercero con un enfoque estratégico, el segundo con un enfoque de emergencia y el cuarto, relacionado con el seguimiento, evaluación, sistematización y difusión del proyecto.",11.1,2,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,3

No fue hasta 1996 que se creó oficialmente el Sector de Hábitat, en el que se inscribe la presente intervención. Se empezó construyendo unas 1.000 viviendas por año y se fue incrementando hasta llegar a las 5.000 viviendas anuales que se construyen en la actualidad, contabilizándose en la actualidad un total de 75.532 nuevos hogares, de las que 3.139 han sido construidas en el último año.  Con este proyecto se pretende actuar sobre dos problemas complementarios: el elevado número de familias empobrecidas que viven en soluciones habitacionales precarias y la práctica de la defecación al aire libre y hábitos de higiene deficientes en el marco de una emergencia sanitaria mundial debido a la pandemia por COVID-19. Estos dos problemas se relacionan con la vulneración del derecho a la vivienda y del derecho al saneamiento, que afecta especialmente a la población perteneciente a los grupos más desfavorecidos del ámbito rural (dalits, castas bajas y grupos tribales) y de forma más aguda a las mujeres y personas con discapacidad. Concretamente, con el presente proyecto se pretende reducir la vulnerabilidad social, económica y ambiental de 61 mujeres dalits y sus familias de la aldea rural de B.T.Project-(GMG), habilitando el derecho a la vivienda y al saneamiento, por medio de la construcción de viviendas con baños y letrinas adecuados a las necesidades de la población local, lo cual tendrá consecuencias muy importantes sobre la salud de la población, especialmente para los niños y las niñas, y la seguridad de las mujeres, y asegurando que la propiedad quede en manos de las mujeres cabeza de familia. También se realizarán talleres de sensibilización en higiene, para adaptarse a las nuevas infraestructuras de baños y letrinas, así como para aumentar la consciencia en la importancia de los buenos hábitos higiénicos y de salud, claves, aún más en el actual contexto de pandemia, para la prevención de enfermedades, incluido la COVID-19. El proyecto además promoverá el desarrollo y el empoderamiento en la capacidad de auto organización de las familias de la comunidad rural de B.T.Project-(GMG), mediante la creación del Comité de Construcción y las formaciones que recibirán, serán las propias familias beneficiarias las que realizarán una parte importe del proceso de compras de materiales y de monitorización de la construcción de las viviendas, lo que hará aumentar el sentimiento de apropiación del proyecto por su implicación en todas las fases del proyecto.Justificación puntuación:BENEFICIARIOS DIRECTOS: 61 familias vulnerables, esto es, un total de 287 personas, de las que 143 son mujeres y 144 son hombres y de las que 139 son menores: 74 niños y",11.1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0073,1

It supports the implementation of five model co-operatives in the housing and agri-food sectors. By the end of the project, the five entrepreneurial model co-operatives are expected to continue growing autonomously and reach even more households in their respective economic sectors.  The project aims to build the skills and capacities of men and women, foster climate-smart economic activities, and facilitate access to funding for co-operatives. The project will therefore increase social and economic opportunities for women by enhancing their economic power. Women leaders play a key role in the project.  Project activities include 1) training and capacity building for participants (co-operative members, co operative leaders, elected officials and managers), 2) acquiring and installing community infrastructure, technology and facilities to meet environmental challenges arising from climate change, 3) activities that are specifically aimed at women, including leadership training and mentoring for women, 4) developing a training program for elected officials and co operative leader members on the importance of women's active participation in decision-making bodies. / Le projet (PROCED) appuie la croissance inclusive et verte en Côte d'Ivoire, au Sénégal et au Ghana en renforçant les coopératives, avec une emphase particulière sur les populations vulnérables et les femmes. Il appuie la mise en place de cinq modèles coopératifs dans les secteurs de l'habitation et de l'agroalimentaire. On s'attend à ce qu'à la fin du projet, les cinq modèles entrepreneuriaux coopératifs puissent continuer à croître de manière autonome et atteindre encore plus de ménages dans leur secteur économique respectif.  En réponse à la pandémie de COVID-19 qui frappe la planète, une intervention COVID de 9 mois a été développée par SOCODEVI dans le cadre du PROCED pour i) assurer la sécurité alimentaire des bénéficiaires du projet, ii) diminuer les impacts de la pandémie sur l'égalité de genre et iii) sur les ressources naturelles.  Sur le plan de la sécurité alimentaire, l'intervention COVID fournira par exemple des semences en vue d'une culture vivrière par les bénéficiaires, des intrants pour pallier leur rareté ou leur prix augmenté et des équipements pour éviter les interruptions dans les chaînes de production et d'approvisionnement. En matière de EG, une campagne de sensibilisation sur les violences basées sur le genre sera organisée et une attention particulière sera donnée aux femmes particulièrement impactées par la pandémie, qui les a rendues entre autres plus économiquement vulnérables.

It supports the implementation of five model co-operatives in the housing and agri-food sectors. By the end of the project, the five entrepreneurial model co-operatives are expected to continue growing autonomously and reach even more households in their respective economic sectors.  The project aims to build the skills and capacities of men and women, foster climate-smart economic activities, and facilitate access to funding for co-operatives. The project will therefore increase social and economic opportunities for women by enhancing their economic power. Women leaders play a key role in the project.  Project activities include 1) training and capacity building for participants (co-operative members, co operative leaders, elected officials and managers), 2) acquiring and installing community infrastructure, technology and facilities to meet environmental challenges arising from climate change, 3) activities that are specifically aimed at women, including leadership training and mentoring for women, 4) developing a training program for elected officials and co operative leader members on the importance of women's active participation in decision-making bodies. / Le projet appuie la croissance inclusive et verte en Côte d'Ivoire, au Sénégal et au Ghana en renforçant les coopératives, avec une emphase particulière sur les populations vulnérables et les femmes. Il appuie la mise en place de cinq modèles coopératifs dans les secteurs de l'habitation et de l'agroalimentaire. On s'attend à ce qu'à la fin du projet, les cinq modèles entrepreneuriaux coopératifs puissent continuer à croître de manière autonome et atteindre encore plus de ménages dans leur secteur économique respectif.  Le projet cherche à renforcer les capacités et les compétences des femmes et des hommes, à favoriser des activités économiques climato-intelligentes et à faciliter l'accès au financement pour les coopératives. Ainsi, le projet permet d'accroître les opportunités économiques et sociales pour les femmes en renforçant leur pouvoir économique. Les femmes leaders jouent un rôle clé dans le projet.  Les activités du projet comprennent : 1) la formation et le renforcement des capacités des participants (membres des coopératives, membres leaders des coopératives, personnes élues et gestionnaires), 2) l'acquisition et installation des infrastructures, technologies et équipements collectifs pour  répondre aux défis environnementaux découlant des changements climatiques, 3) des activités visant spécifiquement les femmes, incluant des formations en leadership et du mentorat pour les femmes, 4) mettre sur pied un programme de formation pour les personnes élues et les membres leaders des coopératives sur l'importance d'une participation active des femmes dans les instances décisionnelles.",9;2;11,1,2,2,0,,1,0,0,1,1,0,,,3

Their houses and shacks are built on sand dunes with regular flooding and frequent fires. In most areas water and toilets are few and far between. It is expensive to reach the city where work may be. Over the next few years a further million people are predicted to be living here. For many years the city authorities have built houses and improved conditions but only a few have benefited. This project will engage large numbers of poor people in saving small amounts every day. This commitment will allow them to access larger sums for local projects and towards improving their basic conditions. A capital fund largely managed by community members will be created for this purpose. Through these activities a new sense of community ownership and trust will have developed and residents will be supported to plan how best to improve their neighbourhood. Once this is established, the city authorities, in recognition of their engagement, has agreed to fund basic settlement improvements, mainly water, toilets and electricity.

Faced with enormous challenges in providing shelter and services of any kind, there are many projects which attempt to improve living conditions. But they do so with little co-ordination or useful information on exactly the scale and extent of the problems. Through a new organisation linked to the University, this project will train and support people to bring existing and new information together on Freetowns slums with the aim of contributing to Freetowns first urban development plan. This could significant improve the quality and coordination of services in the slums, leading to slums dwellers being more secure, safe and better off.

The population is young with an average life expectancy of 48. There are high levels of gender inequality and gender based violence. The vast majority of young girls do not complete their schooling, there are high levels of teenage pregnancy and maternal mortality is the third highest worldwide. The project aims to improve the quality of life of people living in 10 slums in Freetown. Activities will be implemented to improve the sexual and reproductive health (SRH) of young people, particularly young women, and to support youth to develop sustainable livelihoods through training and access to micro-finance loans and loans for enterprise development. An emphasis will be placed on working collaboratively with local and national government as well as with other non-governmental agencies working in Freetown slums. As a result of the project SRH is expected to improve, livelihoods opportunities will be created and household incomes will be increased.

It supports the implementation of five model co-operatives in the housing and agri-food sectors. By the end of the project, the five entrepreneurial model co-operatives are expected to continue growing autonomously and reach even more households in their respective economic sectors.The project aims to build the skills and capacities of men and women, foster climate-smart economic activities, and facilitate access to funding for co-operatives. The project will therefore increase social and economic opportunities for women by enhancing their economic power. Women leaders play a key role in the project.Project activities include 1) training and capacity building for participants (co-operative members, co operative leaders, elected officials and managers), 2) acquiring and installing community infrastructure, technology and facilities to meet environmental challenges arising from climate change, 3) activities that are specifically aimed at women, including leadership training and mentoring for women, 4) developing a training program for elected officials and co operative leader members on the importance of women's active participation in decision-making bodies. / Le projet appuie la croissance inclusive et verte en Côte d'Ivoire, au Sénégal et au Ghana en renforçant les coopératives, avec une emphase particulière sur les populations vulnérables et les femmes.

Entre las problemáticas específicas que enfrentan las PcD en el municipio de Santiago de Cuba, restrictivas de su calidad de vida y participación socioeconómica, se encuentra su baja empleabilidad, la cual también afecta a la unidad familiar, en particular a las mujeres. Las principales causas que inciden en esta problemática y sobre las que el proyecto busca incidir son: - Las limitadas capacidades de las OSC y las entidades públicas locales para generar servicios inclusivos y programas integrados de apoyo a la inserción socio-laboral de las PcD. Ello es resultado de la falta de capacitación del personal y del uso de herramientas de trabajo que incorporen enfoques de inclusión y de equidad de género, la escasa articulación entre dichos actores y sus programas de atención a grupos vulnerables, el déficit de instalaciones, herramientas y recursos para la formación y la orientación dirigidos a las PcD, el deterioro de los talleres y centros de enseñanza y las insuficiencias en currículos/programas formativos, - Las restringidas oportunidades y competencias de las PcD y de las mujeres dentro de su núcleo familiar, para insertarse laboralmente y emprender iniciativas económicas. Ello se debe a su insuficiente preparación técnica y desarrollo de habilidades, su desmotivación para trabajar, el déficit de recursos, ayudas técnicas, orientación y apoyo para iniciar emprendimientos o emplearse, la reducida accesibilidad y adaptación de puestos de trabajo existentes ajustados a sus necesidades, - Las prácticas y actitudes a nivel familiar, social e institucional de sobreprotección y/o de desvalorización hacia las PcD, consecuencia de una limitada cultura social de la discapacidad, del insuficiente conocimiento del marco legal y los derechos de las PcD y las mujeres, y de la falta de sensibilidad y conciencia de directivos/as, empleadores y autoridades sobre las necesidades y derechos de estos grupos sociales. --",,1,0,0,0,,,,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.2747,8

Faced with enormous challenges in providing shelter and services of any kind, there are many projects which attempt to improve living conditions. But they do so with little co-ordination or useful information on exactly the scale and extent of the problems. Through a new organisation linked to the University, this project will train and support people to bring existing and new information together on Freetowns slums with the aim of contributing to Freetowns first urban development plan. This could significant improve the quality and coordination of services in the slums, leading to slums dwellers being more secure, safe and better off.

By reducing energy and water use of buildings, operational costs for house owners will decrease. In many developing countries, the construction sector is booming and fast urbanization often leads to scarcity and thus higher prices for energy and water. Therefore, well-designed urban policies, particularly in the construction sector, can have huge economic, environmental and social impact.

It supports the implementation of five model co-operatives in the housing and agri-food sectors. By the end of the project, the five entrepreneurial model co-operatives are expected to continue growing autonomously and reach even more households in their respective economic sectors.The project aims to build the skills and capacities of men and women, foster climate-smart economic activities, and facilitate access to funding for co-operatives. The project will therefore increase social and economic opportunities for women by enhancing their economic power. Women leaders play a key role in the project.Project activities include 1) training and capacity building for participants (co-operative members, co operative leaders, elected officials and managers), 2) acquiring and installing community infrastructure, technology and facilities to meet environmental challenges arising from climate change, 3) activities that are specifically aimed at women, including leadership training and mentoring for women, 4) developing a training program for elected officials and co operative leader members on the importance of women's active participation in decision-making bodies. / Le projet appuie la croissance inclusive et verte en Côte d'Ivoire, au Sénégal et au Ghana en renforçant les coopératives, avec une emphase particulière sur les populations vulnérables et les femmes.

On s'attend à ce qu'à la fin du projet, les cinq modèles entrepreneuriaux coopératifs puissent continuer à croître de manière autonome et atteindre encore plus de ménages dans leur secteur économique respectif.Le projet cherche à renforcer les capacités et les compétences des femmes et des hommes, à favoriser des activités économiques climato-intelligentes et à faciliter l'accès au financement pour les coopératives. Ainsi, le projet permet d'accroître les opportunités économiques et sociales pour les femmes en renforçant leur pouvoir économique. Les femmes leaders jouent un rôle clé dans le projet.Les activités du projet comprennent : 1) la formation et le renforcement des capacités des participants (membres des coopératives, membres leaders des coopératives, personnes élues et gestionnaires), 2) l'acquisition et installation des infrastructures, technologies et équipements collectifs pour  répondre aux défis environnementaux découlant des changements climatiques, 3) des activités visant spécifiquement les femmes, incluant des formations en leadership et du mentorat pour les femmes, 4) mettre sur pied un programme de formation pour les personnes élues et les membres leaders des coopératives sur l'importance d'une participation active des femmes dans les instances décisionnelles.",13,1,2,2,0,,,,0,1,1,0,,,3

Desde el año 2018, junto con los proyectos de abastecimiento de agua y apoyo a la agricultura, se inició la construcción de un nuevo barrio para la población desplazada, una vez que habían sido aceptados por la población local. Con programas de apadrinamiento, financiación pública, donativos y por supuesto el esfuerzo de los beneficiarios, se han levantado hasta la fecha 6 viviendas, que acogen a familias de desplazados (más información del proyecto puede verse en la web http://placaje.ucm.es/). Se están iniciando nuevas construcciones y parte de la población que no puede permitirse alquiler de vivienda, acampa en los terrenos del nuevobarrio. Poco a poco, se está solventando de manera definitiva el problema de vivienda. Sin embargo, tanto en el nuevo barrio, como en general en Fond Jeannette, son inexistentes o muy escasas las zonas de aseo, así como las letrinas, constituyendo un foco de insalubridad muy propicio para el desarrollo y propagación de enfermedades (incluido el reciente Covid-19). Por este motivo, se plantea la construcción de una primera fase de sieteletrinas que den servicio a las familias que habitan actualmente en las viviendas construidas, dado que a fecha de hoy, todas ellas tienen acceso a una única letrina de una vivienda cercana. Además darán servicio temporalmente al resto de familias desplazadas que se encuentran en esos terrenos hasta que en otra fase con nuestra ayuda o por sus medios, se construyan letrinas para cada familia.

Fase 6 (cierre).El presente proyecto constituye la fase sexta y de cierre del Programa de hábitat domiciliar Ban Chuinklal, desarrollado desde el año 2014 hasta la actualidad (6 años) por las organizaciones consorciadas en el proyecto: Arquitectura Sin Fronteras, ASIAPRODI y FODHAP, y que, a su vez, ha dado continuidad a la línea de habitabilidad básica del Programa de Desarrollo Integral (IDI) Oxlajuj Tz'ikin, promovido por la Cooperación Gallega en los municipios de Champerico y Retalhuleu entre los años 2008 y 2012. Como se ha mencionado, se trata de un proyecto de cierre dentro del programa Ban Chuinklal. Este cierre no está provocado por la superación de los déficits educativos en la región, sino que se considera necesario dar apertura a un espacio de reflexión y de rediseño de la estrategia de trabajo en el departamento. Por un lado, después de seis años de intervención, el proyecto ha logrado y promovido cambios positivos en las comunidades, por otro, el contexto general centroamericano, de Guatemala, de la región y de la cooperación internacional han cambiado, por todo esto se hace necesario un análisis de lo realizado y valorar una reorientación en la estrategia de trabajo. En este sentido ya se ha abierto un proceso, que continuará a lo largo de este año, con titulares de derechos, responsabilidades y obligaciones, con el objetivo de establecer un nuevo enfoque para el abordaje de los déficits habitacionales de todas las comunidades con un enfoque más amplio y que responda mejor a las condiciones y demandas de la población. Como proyecto de cierre, se ha puesto especial atención en la incorporación, en los diferentes resultados, de acciones orientadas, en primer lugar, a la transferencia de capacidades a titulares de obligaciones, responsabilidades y derechos, y, por otro lado, a la evaluación y sistematización de la experiencia del programa. El objetivo sería, como se ha dicho, aprovechar los aprendizajes para un nuevo reenfoque de las acciones o para el traslado de la experiencia a otras regiones de Guatemala. Con respecto al contenido de la intervención del presente proyecto, se ha tratado de recoger los aprendizajes de etapas anteriores, fruto de la reflexión interna del equipo y de la visión externa de las evaluaciones anteriores, definiendo una nueva intervención en materia de hábitat domiciliar con un carácter más integral. El proyecto se estructura en 4 resultados, el primero y el tercero con un enfoque estratégico, el segundo con un enfoque de emergencia y el cuarto, relacionado con el seguimiento, evaluación, sistematización y difusión del proyecto.",11.1,2,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.1911,1

Entre las problemáticas específicas que enfrentan las PcD en el municipio de Santiago de Cuba, restrictivas de su calidad de vida y participación socioeconómica, se encuentra su baja empleabilidad, la cual también afecta a la unidad familiar, en particular a las mujeres. Las principales causas que inciden en esta problemática y sobre las que el proyecto busca incidir son: - Las limitadas capacidades de las OSC y las entidades públicas locales para generar servicios inclusivos y programas integrados de apoyo a la inserción socio-laboral de las PcD. Ello es resultado de la falta de capacitación del personal y del uso de herramientas de trabajo que incorporen enfoques de inclusión y de equidad de género, la escasa articulación entre dichos actores y sus programas de atención a grupos vulnerables, el déficit de instalaciones, herramientas y recursos para la formación y la orientación dirigidos a las PcD, el deterioro de los talleres y centros de enseñanza y las insuficiencias en currículos/programas formativos, - Las restringidas oportunidades y competencias de las PcD y de las mujeres dentro de su núcleo familiar, para insertarse laboralmente y emprender iniciativas económicas. Ello se debe a su insuficiente preparación técnica y desarrollo de habilidades, su desmotivación para trabajar, el déficit de recursos, ayudas técnicas, orientación y apoyo para iniciar emprendimientos o emplearse, la reducida accesibilidad y adaptación de puestos de trabajo existentes ajustados a sus necesidades, - Las prácticas y actitudes a nivel familiar, social e institucional de sobreprotección y/o de desvalorización hacia las PcD, consecuencia de una limitada cultura social de la discapacidad, del insuficiente conocimiento del marco legal y los derechos de las PcD y las mujeres, y de la falta de sensibilidad y conciencia de directivos/as, empleadores y autoridades sobre las necesidades y derechos de estos grupos sociales.",,1,0,,0,,,,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.1696,8

Sida has made an assessment and proposes a 4-year long support (2019-2022), amounting to 275 million SEK. The overarching objective of the intervention is to address the extensive global deficit of affordable and adequate housing and access to basic services such as water and sanitation for people living in poverty. More than one billion people live in informal settlements with substandard access to water and sanitation. By producing affordable houses, the intervention intends to demonstrate that perceived and real obstacles to a functioning sector for affordable housing can be overcome. The intention is that this will attract international and local banks as well as professional building companies and thus catalyse a wider effect. The houses are to be designed to addresses identified blockages to a functioning market for affordable houses and/or bread new grounds in relation to target group, design solutions, financing solutions or other identified needs to systematically address the housing shortage. Dissemination of results and active advocacy efforts to achieve policy development and sustainable financing solutions is to be done continuously. The production of the houses is done by local organisations that are part of Reall s network, through which they receive capacity development support and financing. The local organisations are supported to be able to design and build well planned, affordable and environmentally sustainable houses with a high level of target group participation. Because of lack of other end-user finance alternatives, most of the network organisations provides this service for the target group. Central aspects of the intervention are, -to prove that poor people can and want to finance their own home when the right conditions exist and-to demonstrate that solid work with transparency and a very high level of internal governance and control can make construction processes predictable and reduce the risk of corruption.These two areas are crucial to attract both financiers and other players to the market for low-cost housing.Reall is a non-profit organization based in the UK that supports a network of local organizations. Upon successful assessments, Reall forwards grants to these organisations for functional costs and soft loans for them to build qualitative housing for people with an income between 10-40% on their respective country s income pyramid. The network has presently members in Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Angola, Philippines, Nepal, Pakistan, India, Burkina Faso, Ghana, South Africa, Malawi, Nigeria and Mozambique.Concrete results expected to be generated include 4,000 new adequate and affordable homes, of which an increasing proportion are owned by women or jointly by a man and a woman, as well as an increasing degree of houses adapted",6.2;6.1;11.c;11.7;11.3;11.1,1,1,1,1,0,,1,0,0,1,0,0.0,0.0,3

It supports the implementation of five model co-operatives in the housing and agri-food sectors. By the end of the project, the five entrepreneurial model co-operatives are expected to continue growing autonomously and reach even more households in their respective economic sectors.  The project aims to build the skills and capacities of men and women, foster climate-smart economic activities, and facilitate access to funding for co-operatives. The project will therefore increase social and economic opportunities for women by enhancing their economic power. Women leaders play a key role in the project.  Project activities include 1) training and capacity building for participants (co-operative members, co operative leaders, elected officials and managers), 2) acquiring and installing community infrastructure, technology and facilities to meet environmental challenges arising from climate change, 3) activities that are specifically aimed at women, including leadership training and mentoring for women, 4) developing a training program for elected officials and co operative leader members on the importance of women's active participation in decision-making bodies. / Le projet (PROCED) appuie la croissance inclusive et verte en Côte d'Ivoire, au Sénégal et au Ghana en renforçant les coopératives, avec une emphase particulière sur les populations vulnérables et les femmes.

On s'attend à ce qu'à la fin du projet, les cinq modèles entrepreneuriaux coopératifs puissent continuer à croître de manière autonome et atteindre encore plus de ménages dans leur secteur économique respectif.  En réponse à la pandémie de COVID-19 qui frappe la planète, une intervention COVID de 9 mois a été développée par SOCODEVI dans le cadre du PROCED pour i) assurer la sécurité alimentaire des bénéficiaires du projet, ii) diminuer les impacts de la pandémie sur l'égalité de genre et iii) sur les ressources naturelles.  Sur le plan de la sécurité alimentaire, l'intervention COVID fournira par exemple des semences en vue d'une culture vivrière par les bénéficiaires, des intrants pour pallier leur rareté ou leur prix augmenté et des équipements pour éviter les interruptions dans les chaînes de production et d'approvisionnement. En matière de EG, une campagne de sensibilisation sur les violences basées sur le genre sera organisée et une attention particulière sera donnée aux femmes particulièrement impactées par la pandémie, qui les a rendues entre autres plus économiquement vulnérables. Des mesures seront également prises pour réduire la pression sur les ressources naturelles environnantes déjà fragilisées par les changements climatiques.

Para ello se van a construir 67 viviendas básicas de 290 pies2 compuestas por salón, dormitorio, cocina y aseo de modo que las familias beneficiarias podrán disponer de espacio para el desarrollo de las diferentes actividades. Se realizarán en materiales perdurables, proporcionando protección y seguridad. Se han diseñado 4 modelos con lasmismas características, con diferente distribución, para que cada familia seleccione la que más se juste a sus necesidades culturales.La metodología a emplear para el desarrollo del proyecto es la de autoconstrucción de viviendas por parte de las titulares de derechos, de modo que sean ellas las principales actrices de su desarrollo. Para ello se realizarán talleres de formación teórica en la que se les enseñara albañilería, fontanería, elaboración de ladrillos y carpintería y mediante la construcción de las 67 viviendas obtendrán la capacitación práctica.La contraparte local CESSS trabaja desde hace varios años a favor de la organización comunitaria, lo que hace que parte del trabajo de organización de la comunidad ya este realizado. Así mismo las comunidades se verán fortalecidas al ser necesario el trabajo en equipo para la obtención del resultado esperado, las viviendas.La combinación de la teoría y la práctica tiene por objeto el ampliar las posibilidades laborales de este colectivo de modo que a largo plazo se pueda producir una mejora en la calidad de vida de las familias. A esto hemos de añadir que, una vez finalizado el proyecto, la máquina de elaboración de ladrillo serágestionada por el grupo de mujeres tribales PAZHANGUDI IRULAR MAGALIR KUZHU con el fin de que puedan ampliar y diversificar sus actividades económicas lo que les va a asegurar ingresos mensuales.El objetivo a corto plazo es poder proporcionar una vivienda digna a estas familias lo que repercutirá directamente en su calidad de vida e indirectamente en su autoestima y favorecerá las relacionesfamiliares, así como capacitar a la población para que puedan ser empleados como mano de obra en construcción y así proporcionarles un medio de vida que asegure unos ingresos a sus familias.Una característica innovadora es que los terrenos en el que se van a construir las viviendas están a nombre de las mujeres, lo que implica que una vez completadas estas queden a nombre de ellas favoreciendo así sudesarrollo y garantizándoles un espacio digno y seguro para vivir.",11.1,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.1606,1

The outcome will be the mainstreaming of climate actions in city investment plans in Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and the PRC.The TA has the following outputs:Output 1: Sustainable data management systems for greenhouse gas data assessed and enhanced at city level. To properly monitor a city?s progress in reducing GHGs and enable comparison with the progress of other cities, it is important to have agreed-upon accounting and reporting standards. The TA will use the Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Emission Inventories (GPC).  This project component will facilitate developing and sustaining data management systems for GHG data, promoting multistakeholder engagement and participation. It also includes information technology and communication systems, and training in GPC and other relevant open data methodologies and procedures.Output 2: Recommended investment road maps for low-carbon economic growth at selected cities developed. This output will support selected pilot cities to build road maps for low-carbon urban development. Output 3: A source book on successful practices and measures driving low-carbon economic development at city level developed and disseminated. Successful practices and measures implemented by CAREC cities have not been fully identified, recorded, or disseminated. The source book will disseminate knowledge and lessons, including through global high-level events, and further enhance developing country cooperation on climate change.Output 4: Strengthened capacity for low-carbon city development. This output will consist of a series of capacity building workshops, in which CAREC cities will be encouraged to commit to developing their own low-carbon city road maps by learning from the experiences of pilot cities.

It supports the implementation of five model co-operatives in the housing and agri-food sectors. By the end of the project, the five entrepreneurial model co-operatives are expected to continue growing autonomously and reach even more households in their respective economic sectors.The project aims to build the skills and capacities of men and women, foster climate-smart economic activities, and facilitate access to funding for co-operatives. The project will therefore increase social and economic opportunities for women by enhancing their economic power. Women leaders play a key role in the project.Project activities include 1) training and capacity building for participants (co-operative members, co operative leaders, elected officials and managers), 2) acquiring and installing community infrastructure, technology and facilities to meet environmental challenges arising from climate change, 3) activities that are specifically aimed at women, including leadership training and mentoring for women, 4) developing a training program for elected officials and co operative leader members on the importance of women's active participation in decision-making bodies. / Le projet (PROCED) appuie la croissance inclusive et verte en Côte d'Ivoire, au Sénégal et au Ghana en renforçant les coopératives, avec une emphase particulière sur les populations vulnérables et les femmes.

On s'attend à ce qu'à la fin du projet, les cinq modèles entrepreneuriaux coopératifs puissent continuer à croître de manière autonome et atteindre encore plus de ménages dans leur secteur économique respectif.En réponse à la pandémie de COVID-19 qui frappe la planète, une intervention COVID de 9 mois a été développée par SOCODEVI dans le cadre du PROCED pour i) assurer la sécurité alimentaire des bénéficiaires du projet, ii) diminuer les impacts de la pandémie sur l'égalité de genre et iii) sur les ressources naturelles.Sur le plan de la sécurité alimentaire, l'intervention COVID fournira par exemple des semences en vue d'une culture vivrière par les bénéficiaires, des intrants pour pallier leur rareté ou leur prix augmenté et des équipements pour éviter les interruptions dans les chaînes de production et d'approvisionnement. En matière de EG, une campagne de sensibilisation sur les violences basées sur le genre sera organisée et une attention particulière sera donnée aux femmes particulièrement impactées par la pandémie, qui les a rendues entre autres plus économiquement vulnérables. Des mesures seront également prises pour réduire la pression sur les ressources naturelles environnantes déjà fragilisées par les changements climatiques.L'intervention COVID vient de plus apporter une plus grande résilie",9;2;11,1,2,1,0,0,0,2,0,1,1,0,,0.0,3

It supports the implementation of five model co-operatives in the housing and agri-food sectors. By the end of the project, the five entrepreneurial model co-operatives are expected to continue growing autonomously and reach even more households in their respective economic sectors.The project aims to build the skills and capacities of men and women, foster climate-smart economic activities, and facilitate access to funding for co-operatives. The project will therefore increase social and economic opportunities for women by enhancing their economic power. Women leaders play a key role in the project.Project activities include 1) training and capacity building for participants (co-operative members, co operative leaders, elected officials and managers), 2) acquiring and installing community infrastructure, technology and facilities to meet environmental challenges arising from climate change, 3) activities that are specifically aimed at women, including leadership training and mentoring for women, 4) developing a training program for elected officials and co operative leader members on the importance of women's active participation in decision-making bodies. / Le projet appuie la croissance inclusive et verte en Côte d'Ivoire, au Sénégal et au Ghana en renforçant les coopératives, avec une emphase particulière sur les populations vulnérables et les femmes.

On s'attend à ce qu'à la fin du projet, les cinq modèles entrepreneuriaux coopératifs puissent continuer à croître de manière autonome et atteindre encore plus de ménages dans leur secteur économique respectif.Le projet cherche à renforcer les capacités et les compétences des femmes et des hommes, à favoriser des activités économiques climato-intelligentes et à faciliter l'accès au financement pour les coopératives. Ainsi, le projet permet d'accroître les opportunités économiques et sociales pour les femmes en renforçant leur pouvoir économique. Les femmes leaders jouent un rôle clé dans le projet.Les activités du projet comprennent : 1) la formation et le renforcement des capacités des participants (membres des coopératives, membres leaders des coopératives, personnes élues et gestionnaires), 2) l'acquisition et installation des infrastructures, technologies et équipements collectifs pour  répondre aux défis environnementaux découlant des changements climatiques, 3) des activités visant spécifiquement les femmes, incluant des formations en leadership et du mentorat pour les femmes, 4) mettre sur pied un programme de formation pour les personnes élues et les membres leaders des coopératives sur l'importance d'une participation active des femmes dans les instances décisionnelles.",13,1,2,2,0,,,,0,1,1,0,,,3

Related issues (Comic Relief): Lack of voice, influence, agency. Summary: Over the last twenty years, living conditions for the majority of South Africas poor have hardly improved and for many have worsened. There remains a massive task to provide even the most basic of facilities. Comic Relief is proposing to support three organisations in Cape Town who are working to place the urban poor at the centre of changing their own lives. This has huge potential, but real progress will only be made if these organisations and other key players including the City of Cape Town, local businesses and the urban poor work and learn together. For these initial schemes to be scaled up, lessons and experiences gained from Cape Town need to be carefully recorded, analysed and shared. This project aims to provide the skills and opportunities to enable the three organisations to work together and with others. It will provide guidance as to where to focus, where and how to collect information. It will support the analysis of this information and how to share it with others to best effect. It will also identify where the work can influence policy and practice to scale up impact and significantly change large numbers of lives. The government of the UK (DfID) funded 50 percent of this grant - this share is excluded to avoid double counting in the DAC statistics. Full grant commitment: GBP 476.852 thousand.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3

It supports the implementation of five model co-operatives in the housing and agri-food sectors. By the end of the project, the five entrepreneurial model co-operatives are expected to continue growing autonomously and reach even more households in their respective economic sectors.The project aims to build the skills and capacities of men and women, foster climate-smart economic activities, and facilitate access to funding for co-operatives. The project will therefore increase social and economic opportunities for women by enhancing their economic power. Women leaders play a key role in the project.Project activities include 1) training and capacity building for participants (co-operative members, co operative leaders, elected officials and managers), 2) acquiring and installing community infrastructure, technology and facilities to meet environmental challenges arising from climate change, 3) activities that are specifically aimed at women, including leadership training and mentoring for women, 4) developing a training program for elected officials and co operative leader members on the importance of women's active participation in decision-making bodies. / Le projet (PROCED) appuie la croissance inclusive et verte en Côte d'Ivoire, au Sénégal et au Ghana en renforçant les coopératives, avec une emphase particulière sur les populations vulnérables et les femmes.

On s'attend à ce qu'à la fin du projet, les cinq modèles entrepreneuriaux coopératifs puissent continuer à croître de manière autonome et atteindre encore plus de ménages dans leur secteur économique respectif.En réponse à la pandémie de COVID-19 qui frappe la planète, une intervention COVID de 9 mois a été développée par SOCODEVI dans le cadre du PROCED pour i) assurer la sécurité alimentaire des bénéficiaires du projet, ii) diminuer les impacts de la pandémie sur l'égalité de genre et iii) sur les ressources naturelles.Sur le plan de la sécurité alimentaire, l'intervention COVID fournira par exemple des semences en vue d'une culture vivrière par les bénéficiaires, des intrants pour pallier leur rareté ou leur prix augmenté et des équipements pour éviter les interruptions dans les chaînes de production et d'approvisionnement. En matière de EG, une campagne de sensibilisation sur les violences basées sur le genre sera organisée et une attention particulière sera donnée aux femmes particulièrement impactées par la pandémie, qui les a rendues entre autres plus économiquement vulnérables.

Sida has made an assessment and proposes a 4-year long support (2019-2022), amounting to 275 million SEK. The overarching objective of the intervention is to address the extensive global deficit of affordable and adequate housing and access to basic services such as water and sanitation for people living in poverty. More than one billion people live in informal settlements with substandard access to water and sanitation. By producing affordable houses, the intervention intends to demonstrate that perceived and real obstacles to a functioning sector for affordable housing can be overcome. The intention is that this will attract international and local banks as well as professional building companies and thus catalyse a wider effect. The houses are to be designed to addresses identified blockages to a functioning market for affordable houses and/or bread new grounds in relation to target group, design solutions, financing solutions or other identified needs to systematically address the housing shortage. Dissemination of results and active advocacy efforts to achieve policy development and sustainable financing solutions is to be done continuously. The production of the houses is done by local organisations that are part of Reall s network, through which they receive capacity development support and financing. The local organisations are supported to be able to design and build well planned, affordable and environmentally sustainable houses with a high level of target group participation. Because of lack of other end-user finance alternatives, most of the network organisations provides this service for the target group. Central aspects of the intervention are, -to prove that poor people can and want to finance their own home when the right conditions exist and-to demonstrate that solid work with transparency and a very high level of internal governance and control can make construction processes predictable and reduce the risk of corruption.These two areas are crucial to attract both financiers and other players to the market for low-cost housing.Reall is a non-profit organization based in the UK that supports a network of local organizations. Upon successful assessments, Reall forwards grants to these organisations for functional costs and soft loans for them to build qualitative housing for people with an income between 10-40% on their respective country s income pyramid. The network has presently members in Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Angola, Philippines, Nepal, Pakistan, India, Burkina Faso, Ghana, South Africa, Malawi, Nigeria and Mozambique.Concrete results expected to be generated include 4,000 new adequate and affordable homes, of which an increasing proportion are owned by women or jointly by a man and a woman, as well as an increasing degree of houses adapted",6.2;6.1;11.c;11.7;11.3;11.1,1,1,1,1,0,,1,0,0,1,0,0.0,0.0,3

Sida has made an assessment and proposes a 4-year long support (2019-2022), amounting to 275 million SEK. The overarching objective of the intervention is to address the extensive global deficit of affordable and adequate housing and access to basic services such as water and sanitation for people living in poverty. More than one billion people live in informal settlements with substandard access to water and sanitation. By producing affordable houses, the intervention intends to demonstrate that perceived and real obstacles to a functioning sector for affordable housing can be overcome. The intention is that this will attract international and local banks as well as professional building companies and thus catalyse a wider effect. The houses are to be designed to addresses identified blockages to a functioning market for affordable houses and/or bread new grounds in relation to target group, design solutions, financing solutions or other identified needs to systematically address the housing shortage. Dissemination of results and active advocacy efforts to achieve policy development and sustainable financing solutions is to be done continuously. The production of the houses is done by local organisations that are part of Reall s network, through which they receive capacity development support and financing. The local organisations are supported to be able to design and build well planned, affordable and environmentally sustainable houses with a high level of target group participation. Because of lack of other end-user finance alternatives, most of the network organisations provides this service for the target group. Central aspects of the intervention are, -to prove that poor people can and want to finance their own home when the right conditions exist and-to demonstrate that solid work with transparency and a very high level of internal governance and control can make construction processes predictable and reduce the risk of corruption.These two areas are crucial to attract both financiers and other players to the market for low-cost housing.Reall is a non-profit organization based in the UK that supports a network of local organizations. Upon successful assessments, Reall forwards grants to these organisations for functional costs and soft loans for them to build qualitative housing for people with an income between 10-40% on their respective country s income pyramid. The network has presently members in Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Angola, Philippines, Nepal, Pakistan, India, Burkina Faso, Ghana, South Africa, Malawi, Nigeria and Mozambique.Concrete results expected to be generated include 4,000 new adequate and affordable homes, of which an increasing proportion are owned by women or jointly by a man and a woman, as well as an increasing degree of houses adapted",6.2;6.1;11.c;11.7;11.3;11.1,1,1,1,1,0,,1,0,0,1,0,0.0,0.0,3

GuarantCo, part of the Private Infrastructure Development Group (PIDG), addresses the shortage of long-term, patient funding, and the lack of local currency infrastructure financing and local capital market development in Africa and Asia.Project activities include: (1) providing expertise and financial services to structure contingent credit solutions, especially guarantees, (2) strengthening gender equality, inclusivity and development impact considerations in project design and (3) enhancing the capacity of local financial stakeholders, investors, and project companies to make investment ready projects.Infrastructure projects often face high perceived or real risks or market constraints, including potential losses from borrowing in foreign currencies, making it challenging to obtain sufficient, long-term debt finance. GuarantCo seeks to bridge the gap between a project's financial requirements and the financial terms available from the market by using structured guarantees to help transfer risk, and use long-term patient funding. Its activities mobilize additional investment in low-income countries and fragile states towards the Sustainable Development Goals. / Ce projet vise à améliorer la prestation de services d'infrastructure abordables et durables dans les pays à faible revenu et les États fragiles en vue de lutter contre la pauvreté et de favoriser la croissance économique.

Sida has made an assessment and proposes a 4-year long support (2019-2022), amounting to 275 million SEK. The overarching objective of the intervention is to address the extensive global deficit of affordable and adequate housing and access to basic services such as water and sanitation for people living in poverty. More than one billion people live in informal settlements with substandard access to water and sanitation. By producing affordable houses, the intervention intends to demonstrate that perceived and real obstacles to a functioning sector for affordable housing can be overcome. The intention is that this will attract international and local banks as well as professional building companies and thus catalyse a wider effect. The houses are to be designed to addresses identified blockages to a functioning market for affordable houses and/or bread new grounds in relation to target group, design solutions, financing solutions or other identified needs to systematically address the housing shortage. Dissemination of results and active advocacy efforts to achieve policy development and sustainable financing solutions is to be done continuously. The production of the houses is done by local organisations that are part of Reall  s network, through which they receive capacity development support and financing. The local organisations are supported to be able to design and build well planned, affordable and environmentally sustainable houses with a high level of target group participation. Because of lack of other end-user finance alternatives, most of the network organisations provides this service for the target group. Central aspects of the intervention are, -to prove that poor people can and want to finance their own home when the right conditions exist and-to demonstrate that solid work with transparency and a very high level of internal governance and control can make construction processes predictable and reduce the risk of corruption.These two areas are crucial to attract both financiers and other players to the market for low-cost housing.Reall is a non-profit organization based in the UK that supports a network of local organizations. Upon successful assessments, Reall forwards grants to these organisations for functional costs and soft loans for them to build qualitative housing for people with an income between 10-40% on their respective country  s income pyramid. The network has presently members in Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Angola, Philippines, Nepal, Pakistan, India, Burkina Faso, Ghana, South Africa, Malawi, Nigeria and Mozambique.Concrete results expected to be generated include 4,000 new adequate and affordable homes, of which an increasing proportion are owned by women or jointly by a man and a woman, as well as an increasing degree of houses adapte",6.2;6.1;11.c;11.7;11.3;11.1,1,1,1,1,0,,1,0,0,1,0,0.0,0.0,3

Related issues (Comic Relief): Water and sanitation. Summary: Over 90% of the population of Freetown live in slums, which are characterised by poor housing, overcrowding, poverty, unsanitary conditions and vulnerability to natural hazards. Over 60% of young people are unemployed and have little influence on the development of their communities. This project builds on a previous Y-Care International (YCI)/YMCA project in Freetown which enabled slum dwellers to access clean water, to develop new livelihood options, to access savings and loan services and to influence governments policy on slums. This follow on project will expand the work to another 6 slums in Freetown. There will be a focus on vocational training and enterprise development, life skills and literacy training, youth-led hygiene and health programmes, youth-led advocacy and community disaster preparedness and management planning. New water and toilet facilities will be installed and a small grants programme will be established for use by participating communities. YMCA will also support the further development of the Centre for Dialogue on Human Settlement and Poverty Alleviation (CODOHSAPA) and its work in carrying out community mapping and enumeration, establishing community savings and loan schemes and organising communities to take a lead role in their own development. The government of the UK (DfID) funded 50 percent of this grant - this share is excluded to avoid double counting in the DAC statistics.

Entre las problemáticas específicas que enfrentan las PcD en el municipio de Santiago de Cuba, restrictivas de su calidad de vida y participación socioeconómica, se encuentra su baja empleabilidad, la cual también afecta a la unidad familiar, en particular a las mujeres. Las principales causas que inciden en esta problemática y sobre las que el proyecto busca incidir son: - Las limitadas capacidades de las OSC y las entidades públicas locales para generar servicios inclusivos y programas integrados de apoyo a la inserción socio-laboral de las PcD. Ello es resultado de la falta de capacitación del personal y del uso de herramientas de trabajo que incorporen enfoques de inclusión y de equidad de género, la escasa articulación entre dichos actores y sus programas de atención a grupos vulnerables, el déficit de instalaciones, herramientas y recursos para la formación y la orientación dirigidos a las PcD, el deterioro de los talleres y centros de enseñanza y las insuficiencias en currículos/programas formativos, - Las restringidas oportunidades y competencias de las PcD y de las mujeres dentro de su núcleo familiar, para insertarse laboralmente y emprender iniciativas económicas. Ello se debe a su insuficiente preparación técnica y desarrollo de habilidades, su desmotivación para trabajar, el déficit de recursos, ayudas técnicas, orientación y apoyo para iniciar emprendimientos o emplearse, la reducida accesibilidad y adaptación de puestos de trabajo existentes ajustados a sus necesidades, - Las prácticas y actitudes a nivel familiar, social e institucional de sobreprotección y/o de desvalorización hacia las PcD, consecuencia de una limitada cultura social de la discapacidad, del insuficiente conocimiento del marco legal y los derechos de las PcD y las mujeres, y de la falta de sensibilidad y conciencia de directivos/as, empleadores y autoridades sobre las necesidades y derechos de estos grupos sociales.",,1,0,,0,,,,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.1409,8

UNOPS also provides administrative and operational services to many programs and projects under the UN system. UNOPS builds development-friendly infrastructure in developing countries provides procurement expertise to developing countries and manages projects and programs while enhancing developing countries' own project management capabilities.Cooperation between Finland and UNOPS intensified significantly during 2019. Earlier in 2019 Finland responded positively to the UNOPS inquiry about Finland's interest in hosting the UNOPS Sustainable Infrastructure Impact Investments (S3I) program. Already at this stage Finland also expressed its readiness for the necessary financial commitment in its capacity as the host country.Following negotiations Finland and UNOPS signed the host country agreement on 12 August 2019 which entered into force on 19 January 2020. The Helsinki S3I Program Office officially began its work on 1.3.2020 and its operations will be significantly expanded in the future. In addition to the S3I program the UNOPS Global Innovation and Technology Program will move to Finland.The UN estimates that achieving the Sustainable Development Goals will require investments of around $ 4000 billion annually in developing countries. ODA can only cover a fraction of the amount. With $ 2500 billion in new investment needed each year it will inevitably also require private capital. This requires innovative financing solutions. The UNOPS impact investment program has established itself as an important vehicle for channeling private investments to developing countries, at the same time it helps meet critical national needs for affordable housing and renewable energy. The S3I is playing an increasingly important role in financing the UN's Sustainable Development Goals.Through S3I UNOPS has so far committed to e.g. building more than 860000 homes in Kenya Ghana India Pakistan and the Caribbean. In doing so the program will have a tangible positive impact on the lives of ordinary people while providing hundreds of thousands of local jobs and supporting a sustainable local economy.

The outcome will be the mainstreaming of climate actions in city investment plans in Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and the PRC.The TA has the following outputs:Output 1: Sustainable data management systems for greenhouse gas data assessed and enhanced at city level. To properly monitor a city?s progress in reducing GHGs and enable comparison with the progress of other cities, it is important to have agreed-upon accounting and reporting standards. The TA will use the Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Emission Inventories (GPC). This project component will facilitate developing and sustaining data management systems for GHG data, promoting multistakeholder engagement and participation. It also includes information technology and communication systems, and training in GPC and other relevant open data methodologies and procedures.Output 2: Recommended investment road maps for low-carbon economic growth at selected cities developed. This output will support selected pilot cities to build road maps for low-carbon urban development. Output 3: A source book on successful practices and measures driving low-carbon economic development at city level developed and disseminated. Successful practices and measures implemented by CAREC cities have not been fully identified, recorded, or disseminated. The source book will disseminate knowledge and lessons, including through global high-level events, and further enhance developing country cooperation on climate change.Output 4: Strengthened capacity for low-carbon city development. This output will consist of a series of capacity building workshops, in which CAREC cities will be encouraged to commit to developing their own low-carbon city road maps by learning from the experiences of pilot cities. City government officials, experts, and other relevant stakeholders (including academia, think tanks, and relevant sector-specific organizations that contribute to low-carbon city development) will learn how to enhance low-carbon development.",9;7;6;16;15;12;11;10,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,3

It supports the implementation of five model co-operatives in the housing and agri-food sectors. By the end of the project, the five entrepreneurial model co-operatives are expected to continue growing autonomously and reach even more households in their respective economic sectors.The project aims to build the skills and capacities of men and women, foster climate-smart economic activities, and facilitate access to funding for co-operatives. The project will therefore increase social and economic opportunities for women by enhancing their economic power. Women leaders play a key role in the project.Project activities include 1) training and capacity building for participants (co-operative members, co operative leaders, elected officials and managers), 2) acquiring and installing community infrastructure, technology and facilities to meet environmental challenges arising from climate change, 3) activities that are specifically aimed at women, including leadership training and mentoring for women, 4) developing a training program for elected officials and co operative leader members on the importance of women's active participation in decision-making bodies. / Le projet appuie la croissance inclusive et verte en Côte d'Ivoire, au Sénégal et au Ghana en renforçant les coopératives, avec une emphase particulière sur les populations vulnérables et les femmes.

UNOPS also provides administrative and operational services to many programs and projects under the UN system. UNOPS builds development-friendly infrastructure in developing countries provides procurement expertise to developing countries and manages projects and programs while enhancing developing countries' own project management capabilities.Cooperation between Finland and UNOPS intensified significantly during 2019. Earlier in 2019 Finland responded positively to the UNOPS inquiry about Finland's interest in hosting the UNOPS Sustainable Infrastructure Impact Investments (S3I) program. Already at this stage Finland also expressed its readiness for the necessary financial commitment in its capacity as the host country.Following negotiations Finland and UNOPS signed the host country agreement on 12 August 2019 which entered into force on 19 January 2020. The Helsinki S3I Program Office officially began its work on 1.3.2020 and its operations will be significantly expanded in the future. In addition to the S3I program the UNOPS Global Innovation and Technology Program will move to Finland.The UN estimates that achieving the Sustainable Development Goals will require investments of around $ 4000 billion annually in developing countries. ODA can only cover a fraction of the amount. With $ 2500 billion in new investment needed each year it will inevitably also require private capital. This requires innovative financing solutions. The UNOPS impact investment program has established itself as an important vehicle for channeling private investments to developing countries, at the same time it helps meet critical national needs for affordable housing and renewable energy. The S3I is playing an increasingly important role in financing the UN's Sustainable Development Goals.Through S3I UNOPS has so far committed to e.g. building more than 860000 homes in Kenya Ghana India Pakistan and the Caribbean. In doing so the program will have a tangible positive impact on the lives of ordinary people while providing hundreds of thousands of local jobs and supporting a sustainable local economy. The program contributes in many ways to sustainable development objectives.",9.1;7.2;6.a;11.1,0,0,2,0,1,,,0,0,0,0,,,3

The program fosters the needed education and training for future architects and engineers, in order to drive green building adoption. In the considered countries, there is a strong shortage of skilled professionals. Green Buildings bear great potential to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. They contribute to 19% of GHG emissions globally. One important bottleneck in many countries is the lack of skilled architects and engineers needed to increase the inventory of energy efficient buildings. While the previous engagement aimed in a more general way at stimulating the construction of green buildings through standards/green codes and certification systems, the program will now concentrate on skills development only, thereby complement IFC's broader engagement in this field, the so called Market Accelerator for Green Construction.",13;11.1,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,,0.7549,3

Sida has made an assessment and proposes a 4-year long support (2019-2022), amounting to 275 million SEK. The overarching objective of the intervention is to address the extensive global deficit of affordable and adequate housing and access to basic services such as water and sanitation for people living in poverty. More than one billion people live in informal settlements with substandard access to water and sanitation. By producing affordable houses, the intervention intends to demonstrate that perceived and real obstacles to a functioning sector for affordable housing can be overcome. The intention is that this will attract international and local banks as well as professional building companies and thus catalyse a wider effect. The houses are to be designed to addresses identified blockages to a functioning market for affordable houses and/or bread new grounds in relation to target group, design solutions, financing solutions or other identified needs to systematically address the housing shortage. Dissemination of results and active advocacy efforts to achieve policy development and sustainable financing solutions is to be done continuously. The production of the houses is done by local organisations that are part of Reall s network, through which they receive capacity development support and financing. The local organisations are supported to be able to design and build well planned, affordable and environmentally sustainable houses with a high level of target group participation. Because of lack of other end-user finance alternatives, most of the network organisations provides this service for the target group. Central aspects of the intervention are, -to prove that poor people can and want to finance their own home when the right conditions exist and-to demonstrate that solid work with transparency and a very high level of internal governance and control can make construction processes predictable and reduce the risk of corruption.These two areas are crucial to attract both financiers and other players to the market for low-cost housing.Reall is a non-profit organization based in the UK that supports a network of local organizations. Upon successful assessments, Reall forwards grants to these organisations for functional costs and soft loans for them to build qualitative housing for people with an income between 10-40% on their respective country s income pyramid. The network has presently members in Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Angola, Philippines, Nepal, Pakistan, India, Burkina Faso, Ghana, South Africa, Malawi, Nigeria and Mozambique.Concrete results expected to be generated include 4,000 new adequate and affordable homes, of which an increasing proportion are owned by women or jointly by a man and a woman, as well as an increasing degree of houses adapted",6.2;6.1;11.c;11.7;11.3;11.1,1,1,1,1,0,,1,0,0,1,0,0.0,0.0,3

The project will have the following outcome: acquisition and renovation of housing units by women increased.2. The project will deliver the following outputs: Output 1: Long-term affordable mortgage financing for eligible women borrowers made available. Through the ADB loan HCSBK will provide mortgage loans exclusively targeted at women borrowers to finance at least 3,000 women, Output 2: Accessibility to HCSBKs lending products for eligible women borrowers improved, HCSBK will adopt a gender policy and will conduct at least three nationwide public awareness campaigns on housing finance products for women, Output 3: Gender inclusiveness of the banking sectors housing finance assessed. This output will be delivered by conducting a nationwide study on womens access to housing and finance products which will have to be endorsed by the government.3. ADB will provide HCSBK with an FIL of $100 million equivalent. HCSBK will use the tenge proceeds from ADB to offer affordable residential mortgage finance exclusively to women customers, each acting as the sole borrower and bearer of the legal title to a residential housing unit. The mortgage subloans provided by HCSBK will be used for the acquisition of residential housing units or the renovation of existing homes. A minimum of 60% of the proceeds from the ADB loan will be allocated to provide mortgage loans to female borrowers located in rural regions, i.e., those outside of the four large cities with the lowest poverty rates: Aktau, Almaty, Atyrau and Nur-Sultan. While the maximum monthly income level per household has been set at T320,000, at least 20% of all mortgage loans financed by the ADB loan will be to low-income female borrowers with a monthly household income of less than T200,000. A price ceiling of T30 million will apply for housing units that can be financed under the ADB project, as well as a ceiling of T3.7 million for renovation loans.",8.10;11.1;1.4,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,3

Sida has made an assessment and proposes a 4-year long support (2019-2022), amounting to 275 million SEK. The overarching objective of the intervention is to address the extensive global deficit of affordable and adequate housing and access to basic services such as water and sanitation for people living in poverty. More than one billion people live in informal settlements with substandard access to water and sanitation. By producing affordable houses, the intervention intends to demonstrate that perceived and real obstacles to a functioning sector for affordable housing can be overcome. The intention is that this will attract international and local banks as well as professional building companies and thus catalyse a wider effect. The houses are to be designed to addresses identified blockages to a functioning market for affordable houses and/or bread new grounds in relation to target group, design solutions, financing solutions or other identified needs to systematically address the housing shortage. Dissemination of results and active advocacy efforts to achieve policy development and sustainable financing solutions is to be done continuously. The production of the houses is done by local organisations that are part of Reall s network, through which they receive capacity development support and financing. The local organisations are supported to be able to design and build well planned, affordable and environmentally sustainable houses with a high level of target group participation. Because of lack of other end-user finance alternatives, most of the network organisations provides this service for the target group. Central aspects of the intervention are, -to prove that poor people can and want to finance their own home when the right conditions exist and-to demonstrate that solid work with transparency and a very high level of internal governance and control can make construction processes predictable and reduce the risk of corruption.These two areas are crucial to attract both financiers and other players to the market for low-cost housing.Reall is a non-profit organization based in the UK that supports a network of local organizations. Upon successful assessments, Reall forwards grants to these organisations for functional costs and soft loans for them to build qualitative housing for people with an income between 10-40% on their respective country s income pyramid. The network has presently members in Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Angola, Philippines, Nepal, Pakistan, India, Burkina Faso, Ghana, South Africa, Malawi, Nigeria and Mozambique.Concrete results expected to be generated include 4,000 new adequate and affordable homes, of which an increasing proportion are owned by women or jointly by a man and a woman, as well as an increasing degree of houses adapted",6.2;6.1;11.c;11.7;11.3;11.1,1,1,1,1,0,,1,0,0,1,0,0.0,0.0,3

GuarantCo, part of the Private Infrastructure Development Group (PIDG), addresses the shortage of long-term, patient funding, and the lack of local currency infrastructure financing and local capital market development in Africa and Asia.Project activities include: (1) providing expertise and financial services to structure contingent credit solutions, especially guarantees, (2) strengthening gender equality, inclusivity and development impact considerations in project design and (3) enhancing the capacity of local financial stakeholders, investors, and project companies to make investment ready projects.Infrastructure projects often face high perceived or real risks or market constraints, including potential losses from borrowing in foreign currencies, making it challenging to obtain sufficient, long-term debt finance. GuarantCo seeks to bridge the gap between a project's financial requirements and the financial terms available from the market by using structured guarantees to help transfer risk, and use long-term patient funding. Its activities mobilize additional investment in low-income countries and fragile states towards the Sustainable Development Goals. / Ce projet vise à améliorer la prestation de services d'infrastructure abordables et durables dans les pays à faible revenu et les États fragiles en vue de lutter contre la pauvreté et de favoriser la croissance économique.

The overarching objective of the intervention is to address the extensive global deficit of affordable and adequate housing and access to basic services such as water and sanitation for people living in poverty. More than one billion people live in informal settlements with substandard access to water and sanitation. By producing affordable houses, the intervention intends to demonstrate that perceived and real obstacles to a functioning sector for affordable housing can be overcome. The intention is that this will attract international and local banks as well as professional building companies and thus catalyse a wider effect. The houses are to be designed to addresses identified blockages to a functioning market for affordable houses and/or bread new grounds in relation to target group, design solutions, financing solutions or other identified needs to systematically address the housing shortage. Dissemination of results and active advocacy efforts to achieve policy development and sustainable financing solutions is to be done continuously.

The local organisations are supported to be able to design and build well planned, affordable and environmentally sustainable houses with a high level of target group participation.

Central aspects of the intervention are, -to prove that poor people can and want to finance their own home when the right conditions exist and-to demonstrate that solid work with transparency and a very high level of internal governance and control can make construction processes predictable and reduce the risk of corruption.These two areas are crucial to attract both financiers and other players to the market for low-cost housing.Reall is a non-profit organization based in the UK that supports a network of local organizations.

It will leverage private sector investment to (i) deliver 10,000 affordable green housing units, and (ii) redevelop 100 hectares of ger areas into eco-districts. The project is aligned with the following impacts: living conditions in Mongolia improved, and Ulaanbaatar is a safe, healthy, and green city that is resilient to climate change, and provides a livable environment for its residents. The project will have the following outcome: access to low-carbon and climate-resilient eco-districts and green affordable housing in Ulaanbaatar ger areas increased. The project is consistent with ADB's country partnership strategy for Mongolia, 2017-?2020, and with the core themes of green, competitive, and inclusive cities of ADB?s Urban Operational Plan. The project will have three outputs: (i) resilient urban infrastructure, public facilities, and social housing units in ger areas constructed (public sector component), (ii) long-term financing to developers for low-carbon affordable housing, market rate housing, and economic facilities in ger areas and to households for green mortgages increased (financial intermediation loan [FIL] component), and (iii) sector policy reforms implemented and capacity strengthened. Output 1 will deliver (i) green social housing units with climate adaptation and mitigation features, and (ii) resilient infrastructure, public space, and public facilities. Under output 2, up to $75.7 million of the GCF loan will be made available under the proposed FIL to enable an eco-district and affordable housing fund (EDAF) to provide long-term debt financing (denominated in local currency) to eligible commercial banks to support real estate developers? participation in the low-carbon housing market, and produce affordable green mortgages. Output 3 will support (i) project implementation, (ii) eco-district feasibility and development, policy improvement on climate change adaptation and mitigation, and improved supply and access to affordable green housing units, (iii) detailed design and supervision, and (iv) sustainable green housing finance. Eco-district parameters. The project eco-districts will be low-carbon, climate-resilient, mixed-income, and mixed-use areas with approximately 30% public space. The project?s five phases will deliver about 20 eco-districts or subprojects, with each covering an average of 5 ha. Phase 1 include two core subprojects (10 ha) in Bayankhoshuu and Selbe subcenters, phases 2?3 will have 8 subprojects (40 ha), and phases 4?5 will have 10 subprojects (50 ha). Each subproject should be completed within 5 years. Phases 2?5 will identify and prepare a batch of subprojects to be appraised based on eligibility and selection criteria, including financial and physical parameters",,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,3

Their houses and shacks are built on sand dunes with regular flooding and frequent fires. In most areas water and toilets are few and far between. It is expensive to reach the city where work may be. Over the next few years a further million people are predicted to be living here. For many years the city authorities have built houses and improved conditions but only a few have benefited. This project will engage large numbers of poor people in saving small amounts every day. This commitment will allow them to access larger sums for local projects and towards improving their basic conditions. A capital fund largely managed by community members will be created for this purpose. Through these activities a new sense of community ownership and trust will have developed and residents will be supported to plan how best to improve their neighbourhood. Once this is established, the city authorities, in recognition of their engagement, has agreed to fund basic settlement improvements, mainly water, toilets and electricity. The government of the UK (DfID) funded 50 percent of this grant - this share is excluded to avoid double counting in the DAC statistics.

Related issues (Comic Relief): Water and sanitation. Summary: Freetown slums are in a deplorable state with many areas devoid of piped water and any form of improved sanitation. Most houses are made of temporary building materials and settlements are vulnerable to flooding. Cholera is a recurrent hazard. Comic Relief funded a previous slum project (2008 2012) supporting communities in three slums to improve their quality of life. However, the need to make additional improvements within these settlements and to help others, still exists. This follow-on project intends to support young people, petty traders (particularly women) and other disadvantaged people living in 8 slums in Freetown. The project will provide vocational training and apprenticeships, affordable micro-credit loans and improvement of literacy, business and money management skills. It will also improve access to basic services, including water and improved drainage and provide hygiene training. The capacity of local community based organisations (CBOs) will be strengthened and support provided to improve advocacy skills, enhancing their ability to hold government to account. As a result there will be a healthier environment and increased incomes, especially for women, young people and other marginalised groups, leading to a better quality of life in the slums. In addition the project will promote advocacy relating to streamlining of land tenure systems and seek to influence planning and national housing policy. The government of the UK (DfID) funded 50 percent of this grant - this share is excluded to avoid double counting in the DAC statistics. Full grant commitment: GBP 850 thousand.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3

Related issues (Comic Relief): Sexual abuse or exploitation. Summary: Cultural norms within Sierra Leone influence the unequal relationship between women and men. Women are often seen as the property of men, are taught to be submissive from a young age and are economically dependent. In Freetowns slums Sexual and Gender Based Violence (SGBV) including Female Genital Cutting (FGC), sexual exploitation and harassment, rape, unsafe sexual practices and commercial sex work are common occurrences. Discrimination, poverty, cultural norms, stigmatisation, insufficient knowledge and lack of respect for avenues of justice, contribute to the frequency of SGBV and perpetrators are rarely held accountable. There is a high level of tolerance for domestic violence and a recent study found that 63% of girls aged 15 19 believe it is acceptable for husbands to beat their wives. The proposed pilot project will be implemented in the eight most populated slums in Freetown and is aimed at addressing the root causes of SGBV. As a result of the project, girls, young women and their communities will have increased knowledge and awareness of their rights and the laws related to SGBV and Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH). There will be improved support services for victims of SGBV, as well as increased savings and wider opportunities for improved livelihoods and local community organisations will be better able to influence policy on issues of SGBV and SRH.

The 2014 Ebola outbreak destroyed many lives and many people lost their jobs and sources of income. This project aims to help slum dwellers organise themselves. They will be assisted to document their living conditions, and the findings will help influence wider government policy on slums. These groups will be assisted to start savings schemes, and these will be used to help them start small businesses The project will also set up a Community Fund which will enable slum dwellers to make improvements in their houses and their living conditions. Big Lottery Fund funded 78 percent of this grant but the whole amount is attributed to Comic Relief as no double-counting occurs. Full grant commitment: GBP 3940.345 thousand.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3

This will concentrate on secondary market development and an insurance strategy, including alternative investments and housing finance schemes focusing on gender-based requirements, while improving governance rules in capital markets. Reform area 2: Stability and integrity of the financial system strengthened. There will be focus on implementing the International Financial Reporting Standards 9, revised rules on anti-money laundering based on requirements, and full alignment with Basel III, leading to enhanced stability, efficiency, and inclusiveness in financial markets. Reform area 3: Financial inclusion promoted. This includes financing inclusive green finance and financial technology to promote digital inclusion. The impact of the reform will be the improved economic welfare of the Bhutanese people, especially women, through increased employment, private sector business development, enhanced access to finance, and greater efficiency of financial intermediation.

Sida has made an assessment and proposes a 4-year long support (2019-2022), amounting to 275 million SEK. The overarching objective of the intervention is to address the extensive global deficit of affordable and adequate housing and access to basic services such as water and sanitation for people living in poverty. More than one billion people live in informal settlements with substandard access to water and sanitation. By producing affordable houses, the intervention intends to demonstrate that perceived and real obstacles to a functioning sector for affordable housing can be overcome. The intention is that this will attract international and local banks as well as professional building companies and thus catalyse a wider effect. The houses are to be designed to addresses identified blockages to a functioning market for affordable houses and/or bread new grounds in relation to target group, design solutions, financing solutions or other identified needs to systematically address the housing shortage. Dissemination of results and active advocacy efforts to achieve policy development and sustainable financing solutions is to be done continuously. The production of the houses is done by local organisations that are part of Reall  s network, through which they receive capacity development support and financing. The local organisations are supported to be able to design and build well planned, affordable and environmentally sustainable houses with a high level of target group participation. Because of lack of other end-user finance alternatives, most of the network organisations provides this service for the target group. Central aspects of the intervention are, -to prove that poor people can and want to finance their own home when the right conditions exist and-to demonstrate that solid work with transparency and a very high level of internal governance and control can make construction processes predictable and reduce the risk of corruption.These two areas are crucial to attract both financiers and other players to the market for low-cost housing.Reall is a non-profit organization based in the UK that supports a network of local organizations. Upon successful assessments, Reall forwards grants to these organisations for functional costs and soft loans for them to build qualitative housing for people with an income between 10-40% on their respective country  s income pyramid.

It supports the implementation of five model co-operatives in the housing and agri-food sectors. By the end of the project, the five entrepreneurial model co-operatives are expected to continue growing autonomously and reach even more households in their respective economic sectors.The project aims to build the skills and capacities of men and women, foster climate-smart economic activities, and facilitate access to funding for co-operatives. The project will therefore increase social and economic opportunities for women by enhancing their economic power. Women leaders play a key role in the project.Project activities include 1) training and capacity building for participants (co-operative members, co operative leaders, elected officials and managers), 2) acquiring and installing community infrastructure, technology and facilities to meet environmental challenges arising from climate change, 3) activities that are specifically aimed at women, including leadership training and mentoring for women, 4) developing a training program for elected officials and co operative leader members on the importance of women's active participation in decision-making bodies. / Le projet appuie la croissance inclusive et verte en Côte d'Ivoire, au Sénégal et au Ghana en renforçant les coopératives, avec une emphase particulière sur les populations vulnérables et les femmes.

Sida has made an assessment and proposes a 4-year long support (2019-2022), amounting to 275 million SEK. The overarching objective of the intervention is to address the extensive global deficit of affordable and adequate housing and access to basic services such as water and sanitation for people living in poverty. More than one billion people live in informal settlements with substandard access to water and sanitation. By producing affordable houses, the intervention intends to demonstrate that perceived and real obstacles to a functioning sector for affordable housing can be overcome. The intention is that this will attract international and local banks as well as professional building companies and thus catalyse a wider effect. The houses are to be designed to addresses identified blockages to a functioning market for affordable houses and/or bread new grounds in relation to target group, design solutions, financing solutions or other identified needs to systematically address the housing shortage. Dissemination of results and active advocacy efforts to achieve policy development and sustainable financing solutions is to be done continuously. The production of the houses is done by local organisations that are part of Reall  s network, through which they receive capacity development support and financing. The local organisations are supported to be able to design and build well planned, affordable and environmentally sustainable houses with a high level of target group participation. Because of lack of other end-user finance alternatives, most of the network organisations provides this service for the target group. Central aspects of the intervention are, -to prove that poor people can and want to finance their own home when the right conditions exist and-to demonstrate that solid work with transparency and a very high level of internal governance and control can make construction processes predictable and reduce the risk of corruption.These two areas are crucial to attract both financiers and other players to the market for low-cost housing.Reall is a non-profit organization based in the UK that supports a network of local organizations. Upon successful assessments, Reall forwards grants to these organisations for functional costs and soft loans for them to build qualitative housing for people with an income between 10-40% on their respective country  s income pyramid. The network has presently members in Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Angola, Philippines, Nepal, Pakistan, India, Burkina Faso, Ghana, South Africa, Malawi, Nigeria and Mozambique.Concrete results expected to be generated include 4,000 new adequate and affordable homes, of which an increasing proportion are owned by women or jointly by a man and a woman, as well as an increasing degree of houses adapte",6.2;6.1;11.c;11.7;11.3;11.1,1,1,1,1,0,,1,0,0,1,0,0.0,0.0,3

They contribute to 19% of GHG emissions globally. One important bottleneck in many countries is the lack of skilled architects and engineers needed to increase the inventory of energy efficient buildings.

Para ello se realizarán talleres de formación teórica en la que se les enseñara albañilería, fontanería, elaboración de ladrillos y carpintería y mediante la construcción de las 67 viviendas obtendrán la capacitación práctica.La contraparte local CESSS trabaja desde hace varios años a favor de la organización comunitaria, lo que hace que parte del trabajo de organización de la comunidad ya este realizado. Así mismo las comunidades se verán fortalecidas al ser necesario el trabajo en equipo para la obtención del resultado esperado, las viviendas.La combinación de la teoría y la práctica tiene por objeto el ampliar las posibilidades laborales de este colectivo de modo que a largo plazo se pueda producir una mejora en la calidad de vida de las familias. A esto hemos de añadir que, una vez finalizado el proyecto, la máquina de elaboración de ladrillo serágestionada por el grupo de mujeres tribales PAZHANGUDI IRULAR MAGALIR KUZHU con el fin de que puedan ampliar y diversificar sus actividades económicas lo que les va a asegurar ingresos mensuales.El objetivo a corto plazo es poder proporcionar una vivienda digna a estas familias lo que repercutirá directamente en su calidad de vida e indirectamente en su autoestima y favorecerá las relacionesfamiliares, así como capacitar a la población para que puedan ser empleados como mano de obra en construcción y así proporcionarles un medio de vida que asegure unos ingresos a sus familias.Una característica innovadora es que los terrenos en el que se van a construir las viviendas están a nombre de las mujeres, lo que implica que una vez completadas estas queden a nombre de ellas favoreciendo así sudesarrollo y garantizándoles un espacio digno y seguro para vivir.",11.1,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,3

Sida has made an assessment and proposes a 4-year long support (2019-2022), amounting to 275 million SEK. The overarching objective of the intervention is to address the extensive global deficit of affordable and adequate housing and access to basic services such as water and sanitation for people living in poverty. More than one billion people live in informal settlements with substandard access to water and sanitation. By producing affordable houses, the intervention intends to demonstrate that perceived and real obstacles to a functioning sector for affordable housing can be overcome. The intention is that this will attract international and local banks as well as professional building companies and thus catalyse a wider effect. The houses are to be designed to addresses identified blockages to a functioning market for affordable houses and/or bread new grounds in relation to target group, design solutions, financing solutions or other identified needs to systematically address the housing shortage. Dissemination of results and active advocacy efforts to achieve policy development and sustainable financing solutions is to be done continuously. The production of the houses is done by local organisations that are part of Reall  s network, through which they receive capacity development support and financing. The local organisations are supported to be able to design and build well planned, affordable and environmentally sustainable houses with a high level of target group participation. Because of lack of other end-user finance alternatives, most of the network organisations provides this service for the target group. Central aspects of the intervention are, -to prove that poor people can and want to finance their own home when the right conditions exist and-to demonstrate that solid work with transparency and a very high level of internal governance and control can make construction processes predictable and reduce the risk of corruption.These two areas are crucial to attract both financiers and other players to the market for low-cost housing.Reall is a non-profit organization based in the UK that supports a network of local organizations.

Sida has made an assessment and proposes a 4-year long support (2019-2022), amounting to 275 million SEK. The overarching objective of the intervention is to address the extensive global deficit of affordable and adequate housing and access to basic services such as water and sanitation for people living in poverty. More than one billion people live in informal settlements with substandard access to water and sanitation. By producing affordable houses, the intervention intends to demonstrate that perceived and real obstacles to a functioning sector for affordable housing can be overcome. The intention is that this will attract international and local banks as well as professional building companies and thus catalyse a wider effect. The houses are to be designed to addresses identified blockages to a functioning market for affordable houses and/or bread new grounds in relation to target group, design solutions, financing solutions or other identified needs to systematically address the housing shortage. Dissemination of results and active advocacy efforts to achieve policy development and sustainable financing solutions is to be done continuously. The production of the houses is done by local organisations that are part of Reall s network, through which they receive capacity development support and financing. The local organisations are supported to be able to design and build well planned, affordable and environmentally sustainable houses with a high level of target group participation. Because of lack of other end-user finance alternatives, most of the network organisations provides this service for the target group. Central aspects of the intervention are, -to prove that poor people can and want to finance their own home when the right conditions exist and-to demonstrate that solid work with transparency and a very high level of internal governance and control can make construction processes predictable and reduce the risk of corruption.These two areas are crucial to attract both financiers and other players to the market for low-cost housing.Reall is a non-profit organization based in the UK that supports a network of local organizations.

It supports the implementation of five model co-operatives in the housing and agri-food sectors. By the end of the project, the five entrepreneurial model co-operatives are expected to continue growing autonomously and reach even more households in their respective economic sectors.The project aims to build the skills and capacities of men and women, foster climate-smart economic activities, and facilitate access to funding for co-operatives. The project will therefore increase social and economic opportunities for women by enhancing their economic power. Women leaders play a key role in the project.Project activities include 1) training and capacity building for participants (co-operative members, co operative leaders, elected officials and managers), 2) acquiring and installing community infrastructure, technology and facilities to meet environmental challenges arising from climate change, 3) activities that are specifically aimed at women, including leadership training and mentoring for women, 4) developing a training program for elected officials and co operative leader members on the importance of women's active participation in decision-making bodies. / Le projet appuie la croissance inclusive et verte en Côte d'Ivoire, au Sénégal et au Ghana en renforçant les coopératives, avec une emphase particulière sur les populations vulnérables et les femmes.

Sida has made an assessment and proposes a 4-year long support (2019-2022), amounting to 275 million SEK. The overarching objective of the intervention is to address the extensive global deficit of affordable and adequate housing and access to basic services such as water and sanitation for people living in poverty. More than one billion people live in informal settlements with substandard access to water and sanitation. By producing affordable houses, the intervention intends to demonstrate that perceived and real obstacles to a functioning sector for affordable housing can be overcome. The intention is that this will attract international and local banks as well as professional building companies and thus catalyse a wider effect. The houses are to be designed to addresses identified blockages to a functioning market for affordable houses and/or bread new grounds in relation to target group, design solutions, financing solutions or other identified needs to systematically address the housing shortage. Dissemination of results and active advocacy efforts to achieve policy development and sustainable financing solutions is to be done continuously. The production of the houses is done by local organisations that are part of Reall  s network, through which they receive capacity development support and financing. The local organisations are supported to be able to design and build well planned, affordable and environmentally sustainable houses with a high level of target group participation. Because of lack of other end-user finance alternatives, most of the network organisations provides this service for the target group. Central aspects of the intervention are, -to prove that poor people can and want to finance their own home when the right conditions exist and-to demonstrate that solid work with transparency and a very high level of internal governance and control can make construction processes predictable and reduce the risk of corruption.These two areas are crucial to attract both financiers and other players to the market for low-cost housing.Reall is a non-profit organization based in the UK that supports a network of local organizations. Upon successful assessments, Reall forwards grants to these organisations for functional costs and soft loans for them to build qualitative housing for people with an income between 10-40% on their respective country  s income pyramid. The network has presently members in Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Angola, Philippines, Nepal, Pakistan, India, Burkina Faso, Ghana, South Africa, Malawi, Nigeria and Mozambique.Concrete results expected to be generated include 4,000 new adequate and affordable homes, of which an increasing proportion are owned by women or jointly by a man and a woman, as well as an increasing degree of houses adapte",6.2;6.1;11.c;11.7;11.3;11.1,1,1,1,1,0,,1,0,0,1,0,0.0,0.0,3

Sida has made an assessment and proposes a 4-year long support (2019-2022), amounting to 275 million SEK. The overarching objective of the intervention is to address the extensive global deficit of affordable and adequate housing and access to basic services such as water and sanitation for people living in poverty. More than one billion people live in informal settlements with substandard access to water and sanitation. By producing affordable houses, the intervention intends to demonstrate that perceived and real obstacles to a functioning sector for affordable housing can be overcome. The intention is that this will attract international and local banks as well as professional building companies and thus catalyse a wider effect.

The local organisations are supported to be able to design and build well planned, affordable and environmentally sustainable houses with a high level of target group participation. Because of lack of other end-user finance alternatives, most of the network organisations provides this service for the target group. Central aspects of the intervention are, -to prove that poor people can and want to finance their own home when the right conditions exist and-to demonstrate that solid work with transparency and a very high level of internal governance and control can make construction processes predictable and reduce the risk of corruption.These two areas are crucial to attract both financiers and other players to the market for low-cost housing.Reall is a non-profit organization based in the UK that supports a network of local organizations.

The intention is that this will attract international and local banks as well as professional building companies and thus catalyse a wider effect. The houses are to be designed to addresses identified blockages to a functioning market for affordable houses and/or bread new grounds in relation to target group, design solutions, financing solutions or other identified needs to systematically address the housing shortage. Dissemination of results and active advocacy efforts to achieve policy development and sustainable financing solutions is to be done continuously. The production of the houses is done by local organisations that are part of Reall  s network, through which they receive capacity development support and financing. The local organisations are supported to be able to design and build well planned, affordable and environmentally sustainable houses with a high level of target group participation. Because of lack of other end-user finance alternatives, most of the network organisations provides this service for the target group. Central aspects of the intervention are, -to prove that poor people can and want to finance their own home when the right conditions exist and-to demonstrate that solid work with transparency and a very high level of internal governance and control can make construction processes predictable and reduce the risk of corruption.These two areas are crucial to attract both financiers and other players to the market for low-cost housing.Reall is a non-profit organization based in the UK that supports a network of local organizations. Upon successful assessments, Reall forwards grants to these organisations for functional costs and soft loans for them to build qualitative housing for people with an income between 10-40% on their respective country  s income pyramid. The network has presently members in Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Angola, Philippines, Nepal, Pakistan, India, Burkina Faso, Ghana, South Africa, Malawi, Nigeria and Mozambique.Concrete results expected to be generated include 4,000 new adequate and affordable homes, of which an increasing proportion are owned by women or jointly by a man and a woman, as well as an increasing degree of houses adapte",6.2;6.1;11.c;11.7;11.3;11.1,1,1,1,1,0,,1,0,0,1,0,0.0,0.0,3

They contribute to 19% of GHG emissions globally. One important bottleneck in many countries is the lack of skilled architects and engineers needed to increase the inventory of energy efficient buildings.

The project will therefore increase social and economic opportunities for women by enhancing their economic power. Women leaders play a key role in the project.Project activities include 1) training and capacity building for participants (co-operative members, co operative leaders, elected officials and managers), 2) acquiring and installing community infrastructure, technology and facilities to meet environmental challenges arising from climate change, 3) activities that are specifically aimed at women, including leadership training and mentoring for women, 4) developing a training program for elected officials and co operative leader members on the importance of women's active participation in decision-making bodies. / Le projet appuie la croissance inclusive et verte en Côte d'Ivoire, au Sénégal et au Ghana en renforçant les coopératives, avec une emphase particulière sur les populations vulnérables et les femmes.

In the 2nd year, firstly, ISSB marketing activities will be enhanced. Secondly, ISSB youth groups will be given the contract of ISSB classrooms and perimeter wall construction. Thirdly, mainly by business development facilitators trained in the first year,  entrepreneurship and business development support system  will be strengthened based on Business Support Center.

Sida has made an assessment and proposes a 4-year long support (2019-2022), amounting to 275 million SEK. The overarching objective of the intervention is to address the extensive global deficit of affordable and adequate housing and access to basic services such as water and sanitation for people living in poverty. More than one billion people live in informal settlements with substandard access to water and sanitation. By producing affordable houses, the intervention intends to demonstrate that perceived and real obstacles to a functioning sector for affordable housing can be overcome. The intention is that this will attract international and local banks as well as professional building companies and thus catalyse a wider effect. The houses are to be designed to addresses identified blockages to a functioning market for affordable houses and/or bread new grounds in relation to target group, design solutions, financing solutions or other identified needs to systematically address the housing shortage. Dissemination of results and active advocacy efforts to achieve policy development and sustainable financing solutions is to be done continuously. The production of the houses is done by local organisations that are part of Reall s network, through which they receive capacity development support and financing. The local organisations are supported to be able to design and build well planned, affordable and environmentally sustainable houses with a high level of target group participation. Because of lack of other end-user finance alternatives, most of the network organisations provides this service for the target group. Central aspects of the intervention are, -to prove that poor people can and want to finance their own home when the right conditions exist and-to demonstrate that solid work with transparency and a very high level of internal governance and control can make construction processes predictable and reduce the risk of corruption.These two areas are crucial to attract both financiers and other players to the market for low-cost housing.Reall is a non-profit organization based in the UK that supports a network of local organizations. Upon successful assessments, Reall forwards grants to these organisations for functional costs and soft loans for them to build qualitative housing for people with an income between 10-40% on their respective country s income pyramid. The network has presently members in Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Angola, Philippines, Nepal, Pakistan, India, Burkina Faso, Ghana, South Africa, Malawi, Nigeria and Mozambique.Concrete results expected to be generated include 4,000 new adequate and affordable homes, of which an increasing proportion are owned by women or jointly by a man and a woman, as well as an increasing degree of houses adapted",6.2;6.1;11.c;11.7;11.3;11.1,1,1,1,1,0,,1,0,0,1,0,0.0,0.0,3

Sida has made an assessment and proposes a 4-year long support (2019-2022), amounting to 275 million SEK. The overarching objective of the intervention is to address the extensive global deficit of affordable and adequate housing and access to basic services such as water and sanitation for people living in poverty. More than one billion people live in informal settlements with substandard access to water and sanitation. By producing affordable houses, the intervention intends to demonstrate that perceived and real obstacles to a functioning sector for affordable housing can be overcome. The intention is that this will attract international and local banks as well as professional building companies and thus catalyse a wider effect. The houses are to be designed to addresses identified blockages to a functioning market for affordable houses and/or bread new grounds in relation to target group, design solutions, financing solutions or other identified needs to systematically address the housing shortage. Dissemination of results and active advocacy efforts to achieve policy development and sustainable financing solutions is to be done continuously. The production of the houses is done by local organisations that are part of Reall  s network, through which they receive capacity development support and financing.

Las mujeres Irurales son perteneciente a la tribude los Irurales, tribu indígena de la India y desde siempre considerados como intocables dentro delsistema de castas de la India. Hoy en día, aunque el sistema de casta ya no es en vigor, ladiscriminación hacia este colectivo sigue y son llamados Dalits. Por lo tanto, las mujeres Iruralessufren una triple vulneración (por ser mujeres, por ser Irurales y por ser Dailts) siendo entre loscolectivos más vulnerables de la India. Fundación PROCLADE en cooperación con la contrapartelocal lleva años trabajando para garantizar los derechos básicos de estas personas y en los últimosaños, gracias al programa de vivienda del gobierno denominado Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana hasido posible trabajar de forma eficaz para garantizar el derecho a la vivienda. De hecho, estaintervención repite los mismos objetivos de otras intervenciones que se han llevado a cabo entreel 2018 y el 2022 que han garantizado una vivienda de calidad a más de 112 mujeres y sus familias.El punto de fuerza de este proyecto es la perfecta alineación con las políticas públicas locales devivienda (criterio de eficacia de la ayuda) que se traduce en una verdadera cooperación entretitulares de derecho (mujeres irurales), titulares de responsabilidad (contraparte local y F.PROCLADE) y titulares de obligación (El Gobierno de la India). Gracias a esta cooperación entrelos tres diferentes actores es posible garantizar el derecho a la vivienda para las mujeres Irurales.Esto no significa solo que ellas puedan acceder a una vivienda digna, sino que se ven aumentadosus derechos al tener una casa de propiedad, y por lo tanto ser más visibles frente a lasinstituciones y a la sociedad y tener más facilidad para acceder a otros derechos como por ejemploun trabajo digno. La intervención se va a llevar a cabo en dos fases. En la primera se llevarán acabo las excavaciones y los cimientos, así como dos formaciones sobre temas de construcciónpara las mujeres beneficiarias. En la segunda fase se completará la construcción de las casas y laformación para las mujeres con el objetivo de que tengan conocimientos básicos en construcciónque les puedan ayudar a encontrar un trabajo digno.

It supports the implementation of five model co-operatives in the housing and agri-food sectors. By the end of the project, the five entrepreneurial model co-operatives are expected to continue growing autonomously and reach even more households in their respective economic sectors.The project aims to build the skills and capacities of men and women, foster climate-smart economic activities, and facilitate access to funding for co-operatives. The project will therefore increase social and economic opportunities for women by enhancing their economic power. Women leaders play a key role in the project.Project activities include 1) training and capacity building for participants (co-operative members, co operative leaders, elected officials and managers), 2) acquiring and installing community infrastructure, technology and facilities to meet environmental challenges arising from climate change, 3) activities that are specifically aimed at women, including leadership training and mentoring for women, 4) developing a training program for elected officials and co operative leader members on the importance of women's active participation in decision-making bodies. / Le projet appuie la croissance inclusive et verte en Côte d'Ivoire, au Sénégal et au Ghana en renforçant les coopératives, avec une emphase particulière sur les populations vulnérables et les femmes.

On s'attend à ce qu'à la fin du projet, les cinq modèles entrepreneuriaux coopératifs puissent continuer à croître de manière autonome et atteindre encore plus de ménages dans leur secteur économique respectif.Le projet cherche à renforcer les capacités et les compétences des femmes et des hommes, à favoriser des activités économiques climato-intelligentes et à faciliter l'accès au financement pour les coopératives. Ainsi, le projet permet d'accroître les opportunités économiques et sociales pour les femmes en renforçant leur pouvoir économique.

Sida has made an assessment and proposes a 4-year long support (2019-2022), amounting to 275 million SEK. The overarching objective of the intervention is to address the extensive global deficit of affordable and adequate housing and access to basic services such as water and sanitation for people living in poverty. More than one billion people live in informal settlements with substandard access to water and sanitation. By producing affordable houses, the intervention intends to demonstrate that perceived and real obstacles to a functioning sector for affordable housing can be overcome. The intention is that this will attract international and local banks as well as professional building companies and thus catalyse a wider effect. The houses are to be designed to addresses identified blockages to a functioning market for affordable houses and/or bread new grounds in relation to target group, design solutions, financing solutions or other identified needs to systematically address the housing shortage. Dissemination of results and active advocacy efforts to achieve policy development and sustainable financing solutions is to be done continuously. The production of the houses is done by local organisations that are part of Reall  s network, through which they receive capacity development support and financing. The local organisations are supported to be able to design and build well planned, affordable and environmentally sustainable houses with a high level of target group participation. Because of lack of other end-user finance alternatives, most of the network organisations provides this service for the target group. Central aspects of the intervention are, -to prove that poor people can and want to finance their own home when the right conditions exist and-to demonstrate that solid work with transparency and a very high level of internal governance and control can make construction processes predictable and reduce the risk of corruption.These two areas are crucial to attract both financiers and other players to the market for low-cost housing.Reall is a non-profit organization based in the UK that supports a network of local organizations.

Las mujeres Irurales son perteneciente a la tribude los Irurales, tribu indígena de la India y desde siempre considerados como intocables dentro delsistema de castas de la India. Hoy en día, aunque el sistema de casta ya no es en vigor, ladiscriminación hacia este colectivo sigue y son llamados Dalits. Por lo tanto, las mujeres Iruralessufren una triple vulneración (por ser mujeres, por ser Irurales y por ser Dailts) siendo entre loscolectivos más vulnerables de la India. Fundación PROCLADE en cooperación con la contrapartelocal lleva años trabajando para garantizar los derechos básicos de estas personas y en los últimosaños, gracias al programa de vivienda del gobierno denominado Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana hasido posible trabajar de forma eficaz para garantizar el derecho a la vivienda. De hecho, estaintervención repite los mismos objetivos de otras intervenciones que se han llevado a cabo entreel 2018 y el 2022 que han garantizado una vivienda de calidad a más de 112 mujeres y sus familias.El punto de fuerza de este proyecto es la perfecta alineación con las políticas públicas locales devivienda (criterio de eficacia de la ayuda) que se traduce en una verdadera cooperación entretitulares de derecho (mujeres irurales), titulares de responsabilidad (contraparte local y F.PROCLADE) y titulares de obligación (El Gobierno de la India). Gracias a esta cooperación entrelos tres diferentes actores es posible garantizar el derecho a la vivienda para las mujeres Irurales.Esto no significa solo que ellas puedan acceder a una vivienda digna, sino que se ven aumentadosus derechos al tener una casa de propiedad, y por lo tanto ser más visibles frente a lasinstituciones y a la sociedad y tener más facilidad para acceder a otros derechos como por ejemploun trabajo digno. La intervención se va a llevar a cabo en dos fases. En la primera se llevarán acabo las excavaciones y los cimientos, así como dos formaciones sobre temas de construcciónpara las mujeres beneficiarias. En la segunda fase se completará la construcción de las casas y laformación para las mujeres con el objetivo de que tengan conocimientos básicos en construcciónque les puedan ayudar a encontrar un trabajo digno.

Sida has made an assessment and proposes a 4-year long support (2019-2022), amounting to 275 million SEK. The overarching objective of the intervention is to address the extensive global deficit of affordable and adequate housing and access to basic services such as water and sanitation for people living in poverty. More than one billion people live in informal settlements with substandard access to water and sanitation. By producing affordable houses, the intervention intends to demonstrate that perceived and real obstacles to a functioning sector for affordable housing can be overcome. The intention is that this will attract international and local banks as well as professional building companies and thus catalyse a wider effect. The houses are to be designed to addresses identified blockages to a functioning market for affordable houses and/or bread new grounds in relation to target group, design solutions, financing solutions or other identified needs to systematically address the housing shortage. Dissemination of results and active advocacy efforts to achieve policy development and sustainable financing solutions is to be done continuously. The production of the houses is done by local organisations that are part of Reall  s network, through which they receive capacity development support and financing. The local organisations are supported to be able to design and build well planned, affordable and environmentally sustainable houses with a high level of target group participation. Because of lack of other end-user finance alternatives, most of the network organisations provides this service for the target group. Central aspects of the intervention are, -to prove that poor people can and want to finance their own home when the right conditions exist and-to demonstrate that solid work with transparency and a very high level of internal governance and control can make construction processes predictable and reduce the risk of corruption.These two areas are crucial to attract both financiers and other players to the market for low-cost housing.Reall is a non-profit organization based in the UK that supports a network of local organizations. Upon successful assessments, Reall forwards grants to these organisations for functional costs and soft loans for them to build qualitative housing for people with an income between 10-40% on their respective country  s income pyramid. The network has presently members in Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Angola, Philippines, Nepal, Pakistan, India, Burkina Faso, Ghana, South Africa, Malawi, Nigeria and Mozambique.Concrete results expected to be generated include 4,000 new adequate and affordable homes, of which an increasing proportion are owned by women or jointly by a man and a woman, as well as an increasing degree of houses adapte",6.2;6.1;11.c;11.7;11.3;11.1,1,1,1,1,0,,1,0,0,1,0,0.0,0.0,3

Sida has made an assessment and proposes a 4-year long support (2019-2022), amounting to 275 million SEK. The overarching objective of the intervention is to address the extensive global deficit of affordable and adequate housing and access to basic services such as water and sanitation for people living in poverty. More than one billion people live in informal settlements with substandard access to water and sanitation. By producing affordable houses, the intervention intends to demonstrate that perceived and real obstacles to a functioning sector for affordable housing can be overcome. The intention is that this will attract international and local banks as well as professional building companies and thus catalyse a wider effect. The houses are to be designed to addresses identified blockages to a functioning market for affordable houses and/or bread new grounds in relation to target group, design solutions, financing solutions or other identified needs to systematically address the housing shortage. Dissemination of results and active advocacy efforts to achieve policy development and sustainable financing solutions is to be done continuously. The production of the houses is done by local organisations that are part of Reall  s network, through which they receive capacity development support and financing. The local organisations are supported to be able to design and build well planned, affordable and environmentally sustainable houses with a high level of target group participation. Because of lack of other end-user finance alternatives, most of the network organisations provides this service for the target group. Central aspects of the intervention are, -to prove that poor people can and want to finance their own home when the right conditions exist and-to demonstrate that solid work with transparency and a very high level of internal governance and control can make construction processes predictable and reduce the risk of corruption.These two areas are crucial to attract both financiers and other players to the market for low-cost housing.Reall is a non-profit organization based in the UK that supports a network of local organizations. Upon successful assessments, Reall forwards grants to these organisations for functional costs and soft loans for them to build qualitative housing for people with an income between 10-40% on their respective country  s income pyramid. The network has presently members in Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Angola, Philippines, Nepal, Pakistan, India, Burkina Faso, Ghana, South Africa, Malawi, Nigeria and Mozambique.Concrete results expected to be generated include 4,000 new adequate and affordable homes, of which an increasing proportion are owned by women or jointly by a man and a woman, as well as an increasing degree of houses adapte",6.2;6.1;11.c;11.6;11.3;11.1,1,1,1,1,0,,1,0,0,1,0,0.0,0.0,3

They contribute to 19% of GHG emissions globally. One important bottleneck in many countries is the lack of skilled architects and engineers needed to increase the inventory of energy efficient buildings.

Sida has made an assessment and proposes a 4-year long support (2019-2022), amounting to 275 million SEK. The overarching objective of the intervention is to address the extensive global deficit of affordable and adequate housing and access to basic services such as water and sanitation for people living in poverty. More than one billion people live in informal settlements with substandard access to water and sanitation. By producing affordable houses, the intervention intends to demonstrate that perceived and real obstacles to a functioning sector for affordable housing can be overcome. The intention is that this will attract international and local banks as well as professional building companies and thus catalyse a wider effect. The houses are to be designed to addresses identified blockages to a functioning market for affordable houses and/or bread new grounds in relation to target group, design solutions, financing solutions or other identified needs to systematically address the housing shortage. Dissemination of results and active advocacy efforts to achieve policy development and sustainable financing solutions is to be done continuously. The production of the houses is done by local organisations that are part of Reall  s network, through which they receive capacity development support and financing. The local organisations are supported to be able to design and build well planned, affordable and environmentally sustainable houses with a high level of target group participation. Because of lack of other end-user finance alternatives, most of the network organisations provides this service for the target group. Central aspects of the intervention are, -to prove that poor people can and want to finance their own home when the right conditions exist and-to demonstrate that solid work with transparency and a very high level of internal governance and control can make construction processes predictable and reduce the risk of corruption.These two areas are crucial to attract both financiers and other players to the market for low-cost housing.Reall is a non-profit organization based in the UK that supports a network of local organizations. Upon successful assessments, Reall forwards grants to these organisations for functional costs and soft loans for them to build qualitative housing for people with an income between 10-40% on their respective country  s income pyramid. The network has presently members in Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Angola, Philippines, Nepal, Pakistan, India, Burkina Faso, Ghana, South Africa, Malawi, Nigeria and Mozambique.Concrete results expected to be generated include 4,000 new adequate and affordable homes, of which an increasing proportion are owned by women or jointly by a man and a woman, as well as an increasing degree of houses adapte",6.2;6.1;11.c;11.7;11.3;11.1,1,1,1,1,0,,1,0,0,1,0,0.0,0.0,3

They contribute to 19% of GHG emissions globally. One important bottleneck in many countries is the lack of skilled architects and engineers needed to increase the inventory of energy efficient buildings.

The Russian war against Ukraine has triggered one of the biggest humanitarian crises of all time and escalated the already difficult housing situation. As a result, more than 5.4 million people were internally displaced at the beginning of 2023. In addition, there are an estimated 5.6 million returnees in Ukraine. While the humanitarian response to the crisis continues, there is an urgent need for housing for internally displaced people and other conflict-affected populations such as host communities. The IOM Displacement Report, 2022, shows that an estimated 785,000 IDPs in Ukraine are planning to integrate in their current location. Of the IDPs who hope to integrate in their current location, 44 percent express a need for resettlement assistance. The aim of the project is therefore to improve the living conditions of inte rnally displaced persons and other population groups affected by the conflict by providing affordable and social housing. To this end, the stock of affordable and social housing in selected municipalities (urban communities) will be increased by 350-400 housing units over a project duration of 60 months, while ensuring the proper maintenance and financial management of this stock. The project executing agency is the International Organization for Migration (IOM). In coordination with the Ministry for the Reintegration of Temporarily Occupied Territories of Ukraine (MRTOT), urban settlements in the Poltava and Kirovohrad regions have been identified and pre-selected.",11,1,0,1,0,,,,0,0,0,0,0.0,23.6808,1

Sida has made an assessment and proposes a 4-year long support (2019-2022), amounting to 275 million SEK. The overarching objective of the intervention is to address the extensive global deficit of affordable and adequate housing and access to basic services such as water and sanitation for people living in poverty. More than one billion people live in informal settlements with substandard access to water and sanitation. By producing affordable houses, the intervention intends to demonstrate that perceived and real obstacles to a functioning sector for affordable housing can be overcome. The intention is that this will attract international and local banks as well as professional building companies and thus catalyse a wider effect. The houses are to be designed to addresses identified blockages to a functioning market for affordable houses and/or bread new grounds in relation to target group, design solutions, financing solutions or other identified needs to systematically address the housing shortage. Dissemination of results and active advocacy efforts to achieve policy development and sustainable financing solutions is to be done continuously. The production of the houses is done by local organisations that are part of Reall's network, through which they receive capacity development support and financing. The local organisations are supported to be able to design and build well planned, affordable and environmentally sustainable houses with a high level of target group participation. Because of lack of other end-user finance alternatives, most of the network organisations provides this service for the target group. Central aspects of the intervention are, -to prove that poor people can and want to finance their own home when the right conditions exist and-to demonstrate that solid work with transparency and a very high level of internal governance and control can make construction processes predictable and reduce the risk of corruption.These two areas are crucial to attract both financiers and other players to the market for low-cost housing.Reall is a non-profit organization based in the UK that supports a network of local organizations. Upon successful assessments, Reall forwards grants to these organisations for functional costs and soft loans for them to build qualitative housing for people with an income between 10-40% on their respective country's income pyramid. The network has presently members in Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Angola, Philippines, Nepal, Pakistan, India, Burkina Faso, Ghana, South Africa, Malawi, Nigeria and Mozambique.Concrete results expected to be generated include 4,000 new adequate and affordable homes, of which an increasing proportion are owned by women or jointly by a man and a woman, as well as an increasing degree of houses adapted for residents with functional variations. The houses are intended to directly contribute to an improved standard of living for 20,000 people. As a side effect of improved infrastructure to these settings, another 2000 households will have access to safe water and / or sanitation.",6.2;6.1;11.c;11.7;11.3;11.1,1,1,1,1,0,,1,0,0,1,0,0.0,0.0,3

This construction industry is also known for its poor productivity. Colombia, in particular, has one of the lowest indexes of productivity and at the same time shows a negative growth.This project will contribute to the solution of a particular challenge in the Colombian construction sector, that of optimizing concrete construction for social housing applications. By partnering with a larger research project with similar goals (ACORN), and by involving local industry, this project will advance the state-of-the-art in concrete construction, and build a network of stakeholders working towards sustainability and economic benefits. This partnership represents a true win-win opportunity, with the Colombian context benefitting from the findings of a larger research project, and the UK researchers getting the opportunity to see how their scientific findings can be transferred to a very different social, cultural and economic context.The project has three stages, each with a specific objective. Following an in depth understanding of the ACORN team's approach and findings to-date, the first stage will include interviews with policy makers and industry leaders, to define a specific opportunity to apply the findings in a Colombian social housing context. The second stage will develop the case study by analysing hybrid (not fully-automated) design-to-production possibilities, compatible with the Colombian industrial capabilities, producing a prototype. This will evaluate not only the structural behaviour, but also the sustainability performance and economic viability in comparison to standard practice. The third stage will be dedicated to dissemination of the developed design, testing the viability of its application with stakeholders and defining paths to continue its development.",11.1,0,,,,0,0,0,0,,,,,0.0026,1

It supports the implementation of five model co-operatives in the housing and agri-food sectors. By the end of the project, the five entrepreneurial model co-operatives are expected to continue growing autonomously and reach even more households in their respective economic sectors.The project aims to build the skills and capacities of men and women, foster climate-smart economic activities, and facilitate access to funding for co-operatives. The project will therefore increase social and economic opportunities for women by enhancing their economic power. Women leaders play a key role in the project.Project activities include 1) training and capacity building for participants (co-operative members, co operative leaders, elected officials and managers), 2) acquiring and installing community infrastructure, technology and facilities to meet environmental challenges arising from climate change, 3) activities that are specifically aimed at women, including leadership training and mentoring for women, 4) developing a training program for elected officials and co operative leader members on the importance of women's active participation in decision-making bodies. / Le projet appuie la croissance inclusive et verte en Côte d'Ivoire, au Sénégal et au Ghana en renforçant les coopératives, avec une emphase particulière sur les populations vulnérables et les femmes.

On s'attend à ce qu'à la fin du projet, les cinq modèles entrepreneuriaux coopératifs puissent continuer à croître de manière autonome et atteindre encore plus de ménages dans leur secteur économique respectif.Le projet cherche à renforcer les capacités et les compétences des femmes et des hommes, à favoriser des activités économiques climato-intelligentes et à faciliter l'accès au financement pour les coopératives. Ainsi, le projet permet d'accroître les opportunités économiques et sociales pour les femmes en renforçant leur pouvoir économique. Les femmes leaders jouent un rôle clé dans le projet.Les activités du projet comprennent : 1) la formation et le renforcement des capacités des participants (membres des coopératives, membres leaders des coopératives, personnes élues et gestionnaires), 2) l'acquisition et installation des infrastructures, technologies et équipements collectifs pour  répondre aux défis environnementaux découlant des changements climatiques, 3) des activités visant spécifiquement les femmes, incluant des formations en leadership et du mentorat pour les femmes, 4) mettre sur pied un programme de formation pour les personnes élues et les membres leaders des coopératives sur l'importance d'une participation active des femmes dans les instances décisionnelles.",9;2;11,1,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,,0.0,3

Para ello se plantea la construcción de 29 viviendas, haciendo efectivos los derechos de acceso a una vivienda y al saneamiento de 29 mujeres y sus familiares. Al mismo tiempo, se propone la mejora de los niveles de concienciación y conocimiento sobre el derecho al saneamiento, la higiene y las implicaciones de la defecación al aire libre, a través de la sensibilización de las familias beneficiarias y la población en general. El proyecto también trabaja para equilibrar las relaciones de género puesto que serán las mujeres las propietarias legales de las nuevas viviendas.  A través del acceso y el control de los recursos se espera contribuir a introducir cambios no sólo en las actitudes sino en los roles sociales de estos colectivos. En este sentido también se llevará a cabo un taller sobre Igualdad de Género dirigido a los maridos de las 29 destinarias del proyecto. La participación activa de las mujeres a lo largo de todas las actividades en paridad es también un factor clave para este objetivo. Se busca asimismo empoderar a las beneficiarias a partir de su participación en estructuras de organización comunitaria desde las que pueden reivindicar sus derechos y solicitar cambios para seguir mejorando sus vidas. La ejecución del proyecto se realiza en la Comunidad rural de Chinnamarriveedu. Esta comunidad rural se encuentra ubicada a 20km del área de Yemmiganur y a 55 de la región de Adoni, lo que garantiza un menor impacto ambiental a la hora de realizar el traslado de los materiales hasta la zona. La comunidad de Chinnamarriveedu cuenta con un total de 2.598 personas. Con este proyecto se pretende actuar sobre tres problemas complementarios: el elevado número de mujeres empobrecidas que viven en soluciones habitacionales precarias, la práctica de la defecación al aire libre y hábitos de higiene deficientes y, la vulneración de los derechos económicos que sufren las mujeres. Estos problemas se relacionan con la vulneración del derecho a la vivienda y del derecho al saneamiento, que afecta especialmente a la población perteneciente a los grupos más desfavorecidos del ámbito rural (dálits, castas bajas y grupos tribales) y de forma más aguda a las mujeres. Todas las casas son de tipo Hut, lo que comporta una estructura débil con materiales precarios que se ven altamente vulnerados en épocas de monzones o de condiciones climáticas adversas. A nivel general, considerando las viviendas en las que habitan ahora los beneficiarios y beneficiarias y sus familias, la mayoría sólo cuentan con una estancia, lo cual hace que las familias vivan hacinadas y sin intimidad entre sexos y unidades familiares, con suelos de tierra en muchos casos y techo de paja que no resguarda de las inclemencias climatológicas.",11.1,1,1,,0,0,0,0,0,,,1,0.0,0.0274,1

It supports the implementation of five model co-operatives in the housing and agri-food sectors. By the end of the project, the five entrepreneurial model co-operatives are expected to continue growing autonomously and reach even more households in their respective economic sectors.The project aims to build the skills and capacities of men and women, foster climate-smart economic activities, and facilitate access to funding for co-operatives. The project will therefore increase social and economic opportunities for women by enhancing their economic power. Women leaders play a key role in the project.Project activities include 1) training and capacity building for participants (co-operative members, co operative leaders, elected officials and managers), 2) acquiring and installing community infrastructure, technology and facilities to meet environmental challenges arising from climate change, 3) activities that are specifically aimed at women, including leadership training and mentoring for women, 4) developing a training program for elected officials and co operative leader members on the importance of women's active participation in decision-making bodies. / Le projet appuie la croissance inclusive et verte en Côte d'Ivoire, au Sénégal et au Ghana en renforçant les coopératives, avec une emphase particulière sur les populations vulnérables et les femmes.

On s'attend à ce qu'à la fin du projet, les cinq modèles entrepreneuriaux coopératifs puissent continuer à croître de manière autonome et atteindre encore plus de ménages dans leur secteur économique respectif.Le projet cherche à renforcer les capacités et les compétences des femmes et des hommes, à favoriser des activités économiques climato-intelligentes et à faciliter l'accès au financement pour les coopératives. Ainsi, le projet permet d'accroître les opportunités économiques et sociales pour les femmes en renforçant leur pouvoir économique. Les femmes leaders jouent un rôle clé dans le projet.Les activités du projet comprennent : 1) la formation et le renforcement des capacités des participants (membres des coopératives, membres leaders des coopératives, personnes élues et gestionnaires), 2) l'acquisition et installation des infrastructures, technologies et équipements collectifs pour  répondre aux défis environnementaux découlant des changements climatiques, 3) des activités visant spécifiquement les femmes, incluant des formations en leadership et du mentorat pour les femmes, 4) mettre sur pied un programme de formation pour les personnes élues et les membres leaders des coopératives sur l'importance d'une participation active des femmes dans les instances décisionnelles.",9;2;11,1,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,,0.0,3

Sida has made an assessment and proposes a 4-year long support (2019-2022), amounting to 275 million SEK. The overarching objective of the intervention is to address the extensive global deficit of affordable and adequate housing and access to basic services such as water and sanitation for people living in poverty. More than one billion people live in informal settlements with substandard access to water and sanitation. By producing affordable houses, the intervention intends to demonstrate that perceived and real obstacles to a functioning sector for affordable housing can be overcome. The intention is that this will attract international and local banks as well as professional building companies and thus catalyse a wider effect. The houses are to be designed to addresses identified blockages to a functioning market for affordable houses and/or bread new grounds in relation to target group, design solutions, financing solutions or other identified needs to systematically address the housing shortage. Dissemination of results and active advocacy efforts to achieve policy development and sustainable financing solutions is to be done continuously. The production of the houses is done by local organisations that are part of Reall's network, through which they receive capacity development support and financing. The local organisations are supported to be able to design and build well planned, affordable and environmentally sustainable houses with a high level of target group participation. Because of lack of other end-user finance alternatives, most of the network organisations provides this service for the target group. Central aspects of the intervention are, -to prove that poor people can and want to finance their own home when the right conditions exist and-to demonstrate that solid work with transparency and a very high level of internal governance and control can make construction processes predictable and reduce the risk of corruption.These two areas are crucial to attract both financiers and other players to the market for low-cost housing.Reall is a non-profit organization based in the UK that supports a network of local organizations. Upon successful assessments, Reall forwards grants to these organisations for functional costs and soft loans for them to build qualitative housing for people with an income between 10-40% on their respective country's income pyramid. The network has presently members in Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Angola, Philippines, Nepal, Pakistan, India, Burkina Faso, Ghana, South Africa, Malawi, Nigeria and Mozambique.Concrete results expected to be generated include 4,000 new adequate and affordable homes, of which an increasing proportion are owned by women or jointly by a man and a woman, as well as an increasing degree of houses adapted for residents with functional variations.

To achieve the overall goal and results, the ALCANCE programme will focus its activities in three provinces located in the northern part of Mozambique namely: Nampula, Niassa and Cabo Delgado. We Effect will use its Lichinga Office in Niassa, as the main hub for the overall programme coordination. Sida assesses that the target provinces are well aligned with the increased geographic focus of the Swedish operationalisation plan. We Effect has been implementing several programmes related to Swedish Development cooperation in Mozambique since 1991, with its first field office in the northern province of Niassa on which implemented interventions such as the Programa de Apoio a Sociedade Civil -PASC (contribution ID 23000249) and the Agricultura e Recursos Naturais - ARENA (contribution ID 51140056).  The major bilateral partnership with the Swedish Embassy was through the Actions for an Inclusive and Accountable Governance (AGIR II) programme, 2010-2020 with its sub-programme entitled Natural Resources, Agriculture, Climate Change, and Environment (NACE). For the implementation of NACE, We Effect managed approximately 176 million Swedish Krona. In 2020 as AGIR II programme was being finalized, however an extension of the NACE sub-programme until December 2021 was agreed.The ALCANCE programme is proposed to be implemented in two phases. The  budget for the first phase of  two years amounts to a total amount of 75, 8 MSEK / 456, 44 MMZN (1 SEK = 6,017 MZN),  is presented on a cost-basis with 6 main headers: 66,7% for Funds transfers to partners equal to 50,6 MSEK (312,2 MMZN) and  33,3% equal to 25,2 MMSEK (144,2 MMZN) for We Effect lead activities,  Monitoring and evaluation, Programme staff costs, Programme support costs and Administration overhead. The Embassy assesses that the budget is reasonable in relation to the objectives and provides for a basis for a cost-efficient implementation of the programme.Since the cooperation partner will have a component of forwarding of funds to third partiesâ€™ trough different funding modalities, even though We Effect has systems for planning, monitoring, reporting, evaluation and learning in place, the Embassy's analysis is that both the recurring financial monitoring and operational monitoring of the partners need to be strengthened to ensure that Sida funding is applied properly to achieve the expected programme results.In conclusion,  Sida assesses that the impact of the ALCANCE contribution, lay the ground for an effective, equitable and systems, sustainable livelihoods, improved gender equality and resilient communities to climate change through empowering partner organizations to increase their access to productive land, access and better control of the means of productions as well as increasing the knowledge by women and smallholders farmers about the right to food of three target provinces, Niassa, Nampula and Cabo Delgado.",5.1;2.4;16.7;15.3;1.4,1,1,2,0,1,,0,0,0,1,0,0.0,0.896,1

In the considered countries, there is a strong shortage of skilled professionals. Green Buildings bear great potential to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. They contribute to 19% of GHG emissions globally. One important bottleneck in many countries is the lack of skilled architects and engineers needed to increase the inventory of energy efficient buildings. While the previous engagement aimed in a more general way at stimulating the construction of green buildings through standards/green codes and certification systems, the program will now concentrate on skills development only, thereby complement IFC's broader engagement in this field, the so called Market Accelerator for Green Construction.",15.3;13;11.1,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,,,3

It will leverage private sector investment to (i) deliver 10,000 affordable green housing units, and (ii) redevelop 100 hectares of ger areas into eco-districts. The project is aligned with the following impacts: living conditions in Mongolia improved, and Ulaanbaatar is a safe, healthy, and green city that is resilient to climate change, and provides a livable environment for its residents. The project will have the following outcome: access to low-carbon and climate-resilient eco-districts and green affordable housing in Ulaanbaatar ger areas increased. The project is consistent with ADB's country partnership strategy for Mongolia, 2017-?2020, and with the core themes of green, competitive, and inclusive cities of ADB?s Urban Operational Plan. The project will have three outputs: (i) resilient urban infrastructure, public facilities, and social housing units in ger areas constructed (public sector component), (ii) long-term financing to developers for low-carbon affordable housing, market rate housing, and economic facilities in ger areas and to households for green mortgages increased (financial intermediation loan [FIL] component), and (iii) sector policy reforms implemented and capacity strengthened. Output 1 will deliver (i) green social housing units with climate adaptation and mitigation features, and (ii) resilient infrastructure, public space, and public facilities. Under output 2, up to $75.7 million of the GCF loan will be made available under the proposed FIL to enable an eco-district and affordable housing fund (EDAF) to provide long-term debt financing (denominated in local currency) to eligible commercial banks to support real estate developers? participation in the low-carbon housing market, and produce affordable green mortgages. Output 3 will support (i) project implementation, (ii) eco-district feasibility and development, policy improvement on climate change adaptation and mitigation, and improved supply and access to affordable green housing units, (iii) detailed design and supervision, and (iv) sustainable green housing finance. Eco-district parameters. The project eco-districts will be low-carbon, climate-resilient, mixed-income, and mixed-use areas with approximately 30% public space. The project?s five phases will deliver about 20 eco-districts or subprojects, with each covering an average of 5 ha. Phase 1 include two core subprojects (10 ha) in Bayankhoshuu and Selbe subcenters, phases 2?3 will have 8 subprojects (40 ha), and phases 4?5 will have 10 subprojects (50 ha). Each subproject should be completed within 5 years.

Sida has made an assessment and proposes a 4-year long support (2019-2022), amounting to 275 million SEK. The overarching objective of the intervention is to address the extensive global deficit of affordable and adequate housing and access to basic services such as water and sanitation for people living in poverty. More than one billion people live in informal settlements with substandard access to water and sanitation. By producing affordable houses, the intervention intends to demonstrate that perceived and real obstacles to a functioning sector for affordable housing can be overcome. The intention is that this will attract international and local banks as well as professional building companies and thus catalyse a wider effect. The houses are to be designed to addresses identified blockages to a functioning market for affordable houses and/or bread new grounds in relation to target group, design solutions, financing solutions or other identified needs to systematically address the housing shortage. Dissemination of results and active advocacy efforts to achieve policy development and sustainable financing solutions is to be done continuously.

The local organisations are supported to be able to design and build well planned, affordable and environmentally sustainable houses with a high level of target group participation. Because of lack of other end-user finance alternatives, most of the network organisations provides this service for the target group. Central aspects of the intervention are, -to prove that poor people can and want to finance their own home when the right conditions exist and-to demonstrate that solid work with transparency and a very high level of internal governance and control can make construction processes predictable and reduce the risk of corruption.These two areas are crucial to attract both financiers and other players to the market for low-cost housing.Reall is a non-profit organization based in the UK that supports a network of local organizations.

Sida has made an assessment and proposes a 4-year long support (2019-2022), amounting to 275 million SEK. The overarching objective of the intervention is to address the extensive global deficit of affordable and adequate housing and access to basic services such as water and sanitation for people living in poverty. More than one billion people live in informal settlements with substandard access to water and sanitation. By producing affordable houses, the intervention intends to demonstrate that perceived and real obstacles to a functioning sector for affordable housing can be overcome. The intention is that this will attract international and local banks as well as professional building companies and thus catalyse a wider effect. The houses are to be designed to addresses identified blockages to a functioning market for affordable houses and/or bread new grounds in relation to target group, design solutions, financing solutions or other identified needs to systematically address the housing shortage. Dissemination of results and active advocacy efforts to achieve policy development and sustainable financing solutions is to be done continuously. The production of the houses is done by local organisations that are part of Reall's network, through which they receive capacity development support and financing. The local organisations are supported to be able to design and build well planned, affordable and environmentally sustainable houses with a high level of target group participation. Because of lack of other end-user finance alternatives, most of the network organisations provides this service for the target group. Central aspects of the intervention are, -to prove that poor people can and want to finance their own home when the right conditions exist and-to demonstrate that solid work with transparency and a very high level of internal governance and control can make construction processes predictable and reduce the risk of corruption.These two areas are crucial to attract both financiers and other players to the market for low-cost housing.Reall is a non-profit organization based in the UK that supports a network of local organizations. Upon successful assessments, Reall forwards grants to these organisations for functional costs and soft loans for them to build qualitative housing for people with an income between 10-40% on their respective country's income pyramid. The network has presently members in Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Angola, Philippines, Nepal, Pakistan, India, Burkina Faso, Ghana, South Africa, Malawi, Nigeria and Mozambique.Concrete results expected to be generated include 4,000 new adequate and affordable homes, of which an increasing proportion are owned by women or jointly by a man and a woman, as well as an increasing degree of houses adapted for residents with functional variations. The houses are intended to directly contribute to an improved standard of living for 20,000 people. As a side effect of improved infrastructure to these settings, another 2000 households will have access to safe water and / or sanitation.",6.2;6.1;11.c;11.7;11.3;11.1,1,1,1,1,0,,1,0,0,1,0,0.0,0.0,3

The houses are to be designed to addresses identified blockages to a functioning market for affordable houses and/or bread new grounds in relation to target group, design solutions, financing solutions or other identified needs to systematically address the housing shortage. Dissemination of results and active advocacy efforts to achieve policy development and sustainable financing solutions is to be done continuously. The production of the houses is done by local organisations that are part of Reall's network, through which they receive capacity development support and financing. The local organisations are supported to be able to design and build well planned, affordable and environmentally sustainable houses with a high level of target group participation. Because of lack of other end-user finance alternatives, most of the network organisations provides this service for the target group. Central aspects of the intervention are, -to prove that poor people can and want to finance their own home when the right conditions exist and-to demonstrate that solid work with transparency and a very high level of internal governance and control can make construction processes predictable and reduce the risk of corruption.These two areas are crucial to attract both financiers and other players to the market for low-cost housing.Reall is a non-profit organization based in the UK that supports a network of local organizations. Upon successful assessments, Reall forwards grants to these organisations for functional costs and soft loans for them to build qualitative housing for people with an income between 10-40% on their respective country's income pyramid. The network has presently members in Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Angola, Philippines, Nepal, Pakistan, India, Burkina Faso, Ghana, South Africa, Malawi, Nigeria and Mozambique.Concrete results expected to be generated include 4,000 new adequate and affordable homes, of which an increasing proportion are owned by women or jointly by a man and a woman, as well as an increasing degree of houses adapted for residents with functional variations. The houses are intended to directly contribute to an improved standard of living for 20,000 people. As a side effect of improved infrastructure to these settings, another 2000 households will have access to safe water and / or sanitation.",6.2;6.1;11.c;11.6;11.3;11.1,1,1,1,1,0,,1,0,0,1,0,0.0,0.0,3

It will leverage private sector investment to (i) deliver 10,000 affordable green housing units, and (ii) redevelop 100 hectares of ger areas into eco-districts. The project is aligned with the following impacts: living conditions in Mongolia improved, and Ulaanbaatar is a safe, healthy, and green city that is resilient to climate change, and provides a livable environment for its residents. The project will have the following outcome: access to low-carbon and climate-resilient eco-districts and green affordable housing in Ulaanbaatar ger areas increased. The project is consistent with ADB's country partnership strategy for Mongolia, 2017-?2020, and with the core themes of green, competitive, and inclusive cities of ADB?s Urban Operational Plan.The project will have three outputs: (i) resilient urban infrastructure, public facilities, and social housing units in ger areas constructed (public sector component),  (ii) long-term financing to developers for low-carbon affordable housing, market rate housing, and economic facilities in ger areas and to households for green mortgages increased (financial intermediation loan [FIL] component), and (iii) sector policy reforms implemented and capacity strengthened. Output 1 will deliver (i) green social housing units with climate adaptation and mitigation features, and (ii) resilient infrastructure, public space, and public facilities. Under output 2, up to $75.7 million of the GCF loan will be made available under the proposed FIL to enable an eco-district and affordable housing fund (EDAF) to provide long-term debt financing (denominated in local currency) to eligible commercial banks to support real estate developers? participation in the low-carbon housing market, and produce affordable green mortgages. Output 3 will support (i) project implementation, (ii) eco-district feasibility and development, policy improvement on climate change adaptation and mitigation, and improved supply and access to affordable green housing units, (iii) detailed design and supervision, and (iv) sustainable green housing finance.Eco-district parameters. The project eco-districts will be low-carbon, climate-resilient, mixed-income, and mixed-use areas with approximately 30% public space. The project?s five phases will deliver about 20 eco-districts or subprojects, with each covering an average of 5 ha. Phase 1 include two core subprojects (10 ha) in Bayankhoshuu and Selbe subcenters, phases 2?3 will have 8 subprojects (40 ha), and phases 4?5 will have 10 subprojects (50 ha). Each subproject should be completed within 5 years.  Phases 2?5 will identify and prepare a batch of subprojects to be appraised based on eligibility and selection criteria, including financial and physical parameters, formulated from the feasibility study of the two core subprojects.  A detailed infrastructure and architectural design produced for each subproject will ensure (i) adequate ratio for social (15%), affordable (55%), and market rate (30%) housing units, (ii) balance between public space and amenities, commercial areas, and residential units, and (iii) financial viability and rentability to allow private sector participation. The redevelopment process and housing construction will be undertaken onsite, and will be demand-driven.Sector lending with financial intermediation loan component modality. The sector lending modality was deemed the most appropriate modality to achieve the project objectives because (i) a large number of subprojects in the sector are to be financed, (ii) the government and MUB have sector development plans (SDPs) to ensure the priority development needs of the cross sectoral policy improvement plan are met, and to guide project implementation, (iii) sect",17,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,3

The intention is that this will attract international and local banks as well as professional building companies and thus catalyse a wider effect. The houses are to be designed to addresses identified blockages to a functioning market for affordable houses and/or bread new grounds in relation to target group, design solutions, financing solutions or other identified needs to systematically address the housing shortage. Dissemination of results and active advocacy efforts to achieve policy development and sustainable financing solutions is to be done continuously. The production of the houses is done by local organisations that are part of Reall's network, through which they receive capacity development support and financing. The local organisations are supported to be able to design and build well planned, affordable and environmentally sustainable houses with a high level of target group participation. Because of lack of other end-user finance alternatives, most of the network organisations provides this service for the target group. Central aspects of the intervention are, -to prove that poor people can and want to finance their own home when the right conditions exist and-to demonstrate that solid work with transparency and a very high level of internal governance and control can make construction processes predictable and reduce the risk of corruption.These two areas are crucial to attract both financiers and other players to the market for low-cost housing.Reall is a non-profit organization based in the UK that supports a network of local organizations. Upon successful assessments, Reall forwards grants to these organisations for functional costs and soft loans for them to build qualitative housing for people with an income between 10-40% on their respective country's income pyramid. The network has presently members in Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Angola, Philippines, Nepal, Pakistan, India, Burkina Faso, Ghana, South Africa, Malawi, Nigeria and Mozambique.Concrete results expected to be generated include 4,000 new adequate and affordable homes, of which an increasing proportion are owned by women or jointly by a man and a woman, as well as an increasing degree of houses adapted for residents with functional variations. The houses are intended to directly contribute to an improved standard of living for 20,000 people. As a side effect of improved infrastructure to these settings, another 2000 households will have access to safe water and / or sanitation.",6.2;6.1;11.c;11.7;11.3;11.1,1,1,1,1,0,,1,0,0,1,0,0.0,0.0,3

It supports the implementation of five model co-operatives in the housing and agri-food sectors. By the end of the project, the five entrepreneurial model co-operatives are expected to continue growing autonomously and reach even more households in their respective economic sectors.The project aims to build the skills and capacities of men and women, foster climate-smart economic activities, and facilitate access to funding for co-operatives. The project will therefore increase social and economic opportunities for women by enhancing their economic power. Women leaders play a key role in the project.Project activities include 1) training and capacity building for participants (co-operative members, co operative leaders, elected officials and managers), 2) acquiring and installing community infrastructure, technology and facilities to meet environmental challenges arising from climate change, 3) activities that are specifically aimed at women, including leadership training and mentoring for women, 4) developing a training program for elected officials and co operative leader members on the importance of women's active participation in decision-making bodies. / Le projet appuie la croissance inclusive et verte en Côte d'Ivoire, au Sénégal et au Ghana en renforçant les coopératives, avec une emphase particulière sur les populations vulnérables et les femmes.

On s'attend à ce qu'à la fin du projet, les cinq modèles entrepreneuriaux coopératifs puissent continuer à croître de manière autonome et atteindre encore plus de ménages dans leur secteur économique respectif.Le projet cherche à renforcer les capacités et les compétences des femmes et des hommes, à favoriser des activités économiques climato-intelligentes et à faciliter l'accès au financement pour les coopératives. Ainsi, le projet permet d'accroître les opportunités économiques et sociales pour les femmes en renforçant leur pouvoir économique. Les femmes leaders jouent un rôle clé dans le projet.Les activités du projet comprennent : 1) la formation et le renforcement des capacités des participants (membres des coopératives, membres leaders des coopératives, personnes élues et gestionnaires), 2) l'acquisition et installation des infrastructures, technologies et équipements collectifs pour  répondre aux défis environnementaux découlant des changements climatiques, 3) des activités visant spécifiquement les femmes, incluant des formations en leadership et du mentorat pour les femmes, 4) mettre sur pied un programme de formation pour les personnes élues et les membres leaders des coopératives sur l'importance d'une participation active des femmes dans les instances décisionnelles.",9;2;11,1,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,,0.0,3

Sida has made an assessment and proposes a 4-year long support (2019-2022), amounting to 275 million SEK. The overarching objective of the intervention is to address the extensive global deficit of affordable and adequate housing and access to basic services such as water and sanitation for people living in poverty. More than one billion people live in informal settlements with substandard access to water and sanitation. By producing affordable houses, the intervention intends to demonstrate that perceived and real obstacles to a functioning sector for affordable housing can be overcome. The intention is that this will attract international and local banks as well as professional building companies and thus catalyse a wider effect. The houses are to be designed to addresses identified blockages to a functioning market for affordable houses and/or bread new grounds in relation to target group, design solutions, financing solutions or other identified needs to systematically address the housing shortage. Dissemination of results and active advocacy efforts to achieve policy development and sustainable financing solutions is to be done continuously. The production of the houses is done by local organisations that are part of Reall s network, through which they receive capacity development support and financing. The local organisations are supported to be able to design and build well planned, affordable and environmentally sustainable houses with a high level of target group participation. Because of lack of other end-user finance alternatives, most of the network organisations provides this service for the target group. Central aspects of the intervention are, -to prove that poor people can and want to finance their own home when the right conditions exist and-to demonstrate that solid work with transparency and a very high level of internal governance and control can make construction processes predictable and reduce the risk of corruption.These two areas are crucial to attract both financiers and other players to the market for low-cost housing.Reall is a non-profit organization based in the UK that supports a network of local organizations. Upon successful assessments, Reall forwards grants to these organisations for functional costs and soft loans for them to build qualitative housing for people with an income between 10-40% on their respective country s income pyramid.

It will leverage private sector investment to (i) deliver 10,000 affordable green housing units, and (ii) redevelop 100 hectares of ger areas into eco-districts. The project is aligned with the following impacts: living conditions in Mongolia improved, and Ulaanbaatar is a safe, healthy, and green city that is resilient to climate change, and provides a livable environment for its residents. The project will have the following outcome: access to low-carbon and climate-resilient eco-districts and green affordable housing in Ulaanbaatar ger areas increased. The project is consistent with ADB's country partnership strategy for Mongolia, 2017-?2020, and with the core themes of green, competitive, and inclusive cities of ADB?s Urban Operational Plan.The project will have three outputs: (i) resilient urban infrastructure, public facilities, and social housing units in ger areas constructed (public sector component), (ii) long-term financing to developers for low-carbon affordable housing, market rate housing, and economic facilities in ger areas and to households for green mortgages increased (financial intermediation loan [FIL] component), and (iii) sector policy reforms implemented and capacity strengthened. Output 1 will deliver (i) green social housing units with climate adaptation and mitigation features, and (ii) resilient infrastructure, public space, and public facilities. Under output 2, up to $75.7 million of the GCF loan will be made available under the proposed FIL to enable an eco-district and affordable housing fund (EDAF) to provide long-term debt financing (denominated in local currency) to eligible commercial banks to support real estate developers? participation in the low-carbon housing market, and produce affordable green mortgages. Output 3 will support (i) project implementation, (ii) eco-district feasibility and development, policy improvement on climate change adaptation and mitigation, and improved supply and access to affordable green housing units, (iii) detailed design and supervision, and (iv) sustainable green housing finance.Eco-district parameters. The project eco-districts will be low-carbon, climate-resilient, mixed-income, and mixed-use areas with approximately 30% public space.

Sida has made an assessment and proposes a 4-year long support (2019-2022), amounting to 275 million SEK. The overarching objective of the intervention is to address the extensive global deficit of affordable and adequate housing and access to basic services such as water and sanitation for people living in poverty. More than one billion people live in informal settlements with substandard access to water and sanitation. By producing affordable houses, the intervention intends to demonstrate that perceived and real obstacles to a functioning sector for affordable housing can be overcome. The intention is that this will attract international and local banks as well as professional building companies and thus catalyse a wider effect. The houses are to be designed to addresses identified blockages to a functioning market for affordable houses and/or bread new grounds in relation to target group, design solutions, financing solutions or other identified needs to systematically address the housing shortage. Dissemination of results and active advocacy efforts to achieve policy development and sustainable financing solutions is to be done continuously. The production of the houses is done by local organisations that are part of Reall s network, through which they receive capacity development support and financing. The local organisations are supported to be able to design and build well planned, affordable and environmentally sustainable houses with a high level of target group participation. Because of lack of other end-user finance alternatives, most of the network organisations provides this service for the target group. Central aspects of the intervention are, -to prove that poor people can and want to finance their own home when the right conditions exist and-to demonstrate that solid work with transparency and a very high level of internal governance and control can make construction processes predictable and reduce the risk of corruption.These two areas are crucial to attract both financiers and other players to the market for low-cost housing.Reall is a non-profit organization based in the UK that supports a network of local organizations. Upon successful assessments, Reall forwards grants to these organisations for functional costs and soft loans for them to build qualitative housing for people with an income between 10-40% on their respective country s income pyramid.

It supports the implementation of five model co-operatives in the housing and agri-food sectors. By the end of the project, the five entrepreneurial model co-operatives are expected to continue growing autonomously and reach even more households in their respective economic sectors.The project aims to build the skills and capacities of men and women, foster climate-smart economic activities, and facilitate access to funding for co-operatives. The project will therefore increase social and economic opportunities for women by enhancing their economic power. Women leaders play a key role in the project.Project activities include 1) training and capacity building for participants (co-operative members, co operative leaders, elected officials and managers), 2) acquiring and installing community infrastructure, technology and facilities to meet environmental challenges arising from climate change, 3) activities that are specifically aimed at women, including leadership training and mentoring for women, 4) developing a training program for elected officials and co operative leader members on the importance of women's active participation in decision-making bodies. / Le projet (PROCED) appuie la croissance inclusive et verte en Côte d'Ivoire, au Sénégal et au Ghana en renforçant les coopératives, avec une emphase particulière sur les populations vulnérables et les femmes.

En matière de EG, une campagne de sensibilisation sur les violences basées sur le genre sera organisée et une attention particulière sera donnée aux femmes particulièrement impactées par la pandémie, qui les a rendues entre autres plus économiquement vulnérables.

They contribute to 19% of GHG emissions globally. One important bottleneck in many countries is the lack of skilled architects and engineers needed to increase the inventory of energy efficient buildings.

The SS-KSTA will formulate recommendations for required reforms to strengthen the enabling environment in the real estate markets of Uzbekistan and thereby address the various gaps in the legal and regulatory environment that hamper the development of the mortgage lending in the country, including the conceptualization of a Mortgage Consumer Protection Law for the first time in the country. Furthermore, the SS-KSTA will advise on (i) the operationalization of an Uzbekistan Mortgage Refinancing Company (UMRC), and (ii) establishment of a housing assistance unit (HAU) under the auspices of the Ministry of Finance and (iii) formulation of recommendation to form a coherent government housing strategy and improvements to the existing subsidy programs of the Government.",,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,3

Sida has made an assessment and proposes a 4-year long support (2019-2022), amounting to 275 million SEK. The overarching objective of the intervention is to address the extensive global deficit of affordable and adequate housing and access to basic services such as water and sanitation for people living in poverty. More than one billion people live in informal settlements with substandard access to water and sanitation. By producing affordable houses, the intervention intends to demonstrate that perceived and real obstacles to a functioning sector for affordable housing can be overcome. The intention is that this will attract international and local banks as well as professional building companies and thus catalyse a wider effect. The houses are to be designed to addresses identified blockages to a functioning market for affordable houses and/or bread new grounds in relation to target group, design solutions, financing solutions or other identified needs to systematically address the housing shortage. Dissemination of results and active advocacy efforts to achieve policy development and sustainable financing solutions is to be done continuously. The production of the houses is done by local organisations that are part of Reall  s network, through which they receive capacity development support and financing. The local organisations are supported to be able to design and build well planned, affordable and environmentally sustainable houses with a high level of target group participation. Because of lack of other end-user finance alternatives, most of the network organisations provides this service for the target group. Central aspects of the intervention are, -to prove that poor people can and want to finance their own home when the right conditions exist and-to demonstrate that solid work with transparency and a very high level of internal governance and control can make construction processes predictable and reduce the risk of corruption.These two areas are crucial to attract both financiers and other players to the market for low-cost housing.Reall is a non-profit organization based in the UK that supports a network of local organizations. Upon successful assessments, Reall forwards grants to these organisations for functional costs and soft loans for them to build qualitative housing for people with an income between 10-40% on their respective country  s income pyramid.

This project component will leverage the National Housing Development Corporation Limited's (NHDCL) access to developable, serviced land to build an estimated 1,000 units for rent (with the opportunity for home ownership) and six integrated community service centers, serviced with roads, electricity, municipal, water and sewerage connections in support of the Sustainable Development Goal 1. This output includes components under the Asian Development Fund Thematic Pool grant to provide decent accommodation for families of urban workers, integrated service centers, and livelihood support for women. It is expected that the increase in supply of affordable houses will mitigate the rental shortage. The mid-rise multi-unit buildings will incorporate gender inclusive features and innovations in design, construction methodology, and operation and maintenance including the application of resilient and smart technology to improve resource-efficiency and greater use of locally available materials to boost local economic development. Climate and disaster resilient design features will be identified through a site risk assessment and take a multi-hazard approach. Bhutan cultural values and traditional architecture, aimed at improved public housing amenity, and green facilities will be reflected in the project. Additionally the site plans for each site will be designed in accordance with urban planning guidelines to incorporate appropriate green and public spaces for the location. The subprojects will be integrated with the surrounding community to the greatest extent possible given the constraints. Output 2. Institutional capacities, policy, and regulatory framework of the housing sector strengthened. This project component will (i) strengthen the NHDCL's housing management and construction capacity by assessing its current policies and procedures, and develop targeted housing for low-income groups, particularly women and youth, and revamping the rent-to-own scheme, (ii) develop disaster and climate resilient designs and related technologies, as a means to also improve resource-efficiency (leading to lower price to income), (iii) review and update the building code and regulations, (iv) conduct awareness trainings and a capacity building program for key project stakeholders on (a) disaster and climate resilient designs, and (b) the building code to effectively implement the designs, for enhanced seismic resilience, (v) enhance NHDCL operating business model with piloting of a public-private partnership focused on operation and maintenance for the units, (vi) deve",5.4;13.a;11.1;1.5,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,3

Sida has made an assessment and proposes a 4-year long support (2019-2022), amounting to 275 million SEK. The overarching objective of the intervention is to address the extensive global deficit of affordable and adequate housing and access to basic services such as water and sanitation for people living in poverty. More than one billion people live in informal settlements with substandard access to water and sanitation. By producing affordable houses, the intervention intends to demonstrate that perceived and real obstacles to a functioning sector for affordable housing can be overcome.

Dissemination of results and active advocacy efforts to achieve policy development and sustainable financing solutions is to be done continuously. The production of the houses is done by local organisations that are part of Reall s network, through which they receive capacity development support and financing. The local organisations are supported to be able to design and build well planned, affordable and environmentally sustainable houses with a high level of target group participation. Because of lack of other end-user finance alternatives, most of the network organisations provides this service for the target group. Central aspects of the intervention are, -to prove that poor people can and want to finance their own home when the right conditions exist and-to demonstrate that solid work with transparency and a very high level of internal governance and control can make construction processes predictable and reduce the risk of corruption.These two areas are crucial to attract both financiers and other players to the market for low-cost housing.Reall is a non-profit organization based in the UK that supports a network of local organizations.

Sida has made an assessment and proposes a 4-year long support (2019-2022), amounting to 275 million SEK. The overarching objective of the intervention is to address the extensive global deficit of affordable and adequate housing and access to basic services such as water and sanitation for people living in poverty. More than one billion people live in informal settlements with substandard access to water and sanitation. By producing affordable houses, the intervention intends to demonstrate that perceived and real obstacles to a functioning sector for affordable housing can be overcome. The intention is that this will attract international and local banks as well as professional building companies and thus catalyse a wider effect. The houses are to be designed to addresses identified blockages to a functioning market for affordable houses and/or bread new grounds in relation to target group, design solutions, financing solutions or other identified needs to systematically address the housing shortage. Dissemination of results and active advocacy efforts to achieve policy development and sustainable financing solutions is to be done continuously. The production of the houses is done by local organisations that are part of Reall  s network, through which they receive capacity development support and financing. The local organisations are supported to be able to design and build well planned, affordable and environmentally sustainable houses with a high level of target group participation. Because of lack of other end-user finance alternatives, most of the network organisations provides this service for the target group. Central aspects of the intervention are, -to prove that poor people can and want to finance their own home when the right conditions exist and-to demonstrate that solid work with transparency and a very high level of internal governance and control can make construction processes predictable and reduce the risk of corruption.These two areas are crucial to attract both financiers and other players to the market for low-cost housing.Reall is a non-profit organization based in the UK that supports a network of local organizations. Upon successful assessments, Reall forwards grants to these organisations for functional costs and soft loans for them to build qualitative housing for people with an income between 10-40% on their respective country  s income pyramid. The network has presently members in Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Angola, Philippines, Nepal, Pakistan, India, Burkina Faso, Ghana, South Africa, Malawi, Nigeria and Mozambique.Concrete results expected to be generated include 4,000 new adequate and affordable homes, of which an increasing proportion are owned by women or jointly by a man and a woman, as well as an increasing degree of houses adapte",6.2;6.1;11.c;11.7;11.3;11.1,1,1,1,1,0,,1,0,0,1,0,0.0,0.0,3

Sida has made an assessment and proposes a 4-year long support (2019-2022), amounting to 275 million SEK. The overarching objective of the intervention is to address the extensive global deficit of affordable and adequate housing and access to basic services such as water and sanitation for people living in poverty. More than one billion people live in informal settlements with substandard access to water and sanitation. By producing affordable houses, the intervention intends to demonstrate that perceived and real obstacles to a functioning sector for affordable housing can be overcome. The intention is that this will attract international and local banks as well as professional building companies and thus catalyse a wider effect. The houses are to be designed to addresses identified blockages to a functioning market for affordable houses and/or bread new grounds in relation to target group, design solutions, financing solutions or other identified needs to systematically address the housing shortage. Dissemination of results and active advocacy efforts to achieve policy development and sustainable financing solutions is to be done continuously. The production of the houses is done by local organisations that are part of Reall  s network, through which they receive capacity development support and financing. The local organisations are supported to be able to design and build well planned, affordable and environmentally sustainable houses with a high level of target group participation. Because of lack of other end-user finance alternatives, most of the network organisations provides this service for the target group. Central aspects of the intervention are, -to prove that poor people can and want to finance their own home when the right conditions exist and-to demonstrate that solid work with transparency and a very high level of internal governance and control can make construction processes predictable and reduce the risk of corruption.These two areas are crucial to attract both financiers and other players to the market for low-cost housing.Reall is a non-profit organization based in the UK that supports a network of local organizations. Upon successful assessments, Reall forwards grants to these organisations for functional costs and soft loans for them to build qualitative housing for people with an income between 10-40% on their respective country  s income pyramid. The network has presently members in Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Angola, Philippines, Nepal, Pakistan, India, Burkina Faso, Ghana, South Africa, Malawi, Nigeria and Mozambique.Concrete results expected to be generated include 4,000 new adequate and affordable homes, of which an increasing proportion are owned by women or jointly by a man and a woman, as well as an increasing degree of houses adapte",6.2;6.1;11.c;11.7;11.3;11.1,1,1,1,1,0,,1,0,0,1,0,0.0,0.0,3

The project will have the following outcome: housing affordability for low-income individuals in designated communities improved. The outputs are: Output 1. Climate and disaster resilient, and affordable housing units and public facilities for low-income individuals constructed. This project component will leverage the National Housing Development Corporation Limited's (NHDCL) access to developable, serviced land to build an estimated 1,000 units for rent (with the opportunity for home ownership) and six integrated community service centers, serviced with roads, electricity, municipal, water and sewerage connections in support of the Sustainable Development Goal 1. This output includes components under the Asian Development Fund Thematic Pool grant to provide decent accommodation for families of urban workers, integrated service centers, and livelihood support for women. It is expected that the increase in supply of affordable houses will mitigate the rental shortage. The mid-rise multi-unit buildings will incorporate gender inclusive features and innovations in design, construction methodology, and operation and maintenance including the application of resilient and smart technology to improve resource-efficiency and greater use of locally available materials to boost local economic development. Climate and disaster resilient design features will be identified through a site risk assessment and take a multi-hazard approach. Bhutan cultural values and traditional architecture, aimed at improved public housing amenity, and green facilities will be reflected in the project. Additionally the site plans for each site will be designed in accordance with urban planning guidelines to incorporate appropriate green and public spaces for the location. The subprojects will be integrated with the surrounding community to the greatest extent possible given the constraints. Output 2.

Sida has made an assessment and proposes a 4-year long support (2019-2022), amounting to 275 million SEK. The overarching objective of the intervention is to address the extensive global deficit of affordable and adequate housing and access to basic services such as water and sanitation for people living in poverty. More than one billion people live in informal settlements with substandard access to water and sanitation. By producing affordable houses, the intervention intends to demonstrate that perceived and real obstacles to a functioning sector for affordable housing can be overcome. The intention is that this will attract international and local banks as well as professional building companies and thus catalyse a wider effect. The houses are to be designed to addresses identified blockages to a functioning market for affordable houses and/or bread new grounds in relation to target group, design solutions, financing solutions or other identified needs to systematically address the housing shortage. Dissemination of results and active advocacy efforts to achieve policy development and sustainable financing solutions is to be done continuously. The production of the houses is done by local organisations that are part of Reall  s network, through which they receive capacity development support and financing. The local organisations are supported to be able to design and build well planned, affordable and environmentally sustainable houses with a high level of target group participation. Because of lack of other end-user finance alternatives, most of the network organisations provides this service for the target group. Central aspects of the intervention are, -to prove that poor people can and want to finance their own home when the right conditions exist and-to demonstrate that solid work with transparency and a very high level of internal governance and control can make construction processes predictable and reduce the risk of corruption.These two areas are crucial to attract both financiers and other players to the market for low-cost housing.Reall is a non-profit organization based in the UK that supports a network of local organizations. Upon successful assessments, Reall forwards grants to these organisations for functional costs and soft loans for them to build qualitative housing for people with an income between 10-40% on their respective country  s income pyramid. The network has presently members in Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Angola, Philippines, Nepal, Pakistan, India, Burkina Faso, Ghana, South Africa, Malawi, Nigeria and Mozambique.Concrete results expected to be generated include 4,000 new adequate and affordable homes, of which an increasing proportion are owned by women or jointly by a man and a woman, as well as an increasing degree of houses adapte",6.2;6.1;11.c;11.7;11.3;11.1,1,1,1,1,0,,1,0,0,1,0,0.0,0.0,3

The overarching objective of the intervention is to address the extensive global deficit of affordable and adequate housing and access to basic services such as water and sanitation for people living in poverty. More than one billion people live in informal settlements with substandard access to water and sanitation. By producing affordable houses, the intervention intends to demonstrate that perceived and real obstacles to a functioning sector for affordable housing can be overcome.

It will leverage private sector investment to (i) deliver 10,000 affordable green housing units, and (ii) redevelop 100 hectares of ger areas into eco-districts. The project is aligned with the following impacts: living conditions in Mongolia improved, and Ulaanbaatar is a safe, healthy, and green city that is resilient to climate change, and provides a livable environment for its residents. The project will have the following outcome: access to low-carbon and climate-resilient eco-districts and green affordable housing in Ulaanbaatar ger areas increased. The project is consistent with ADB's country partnership strategy for Mongolia, 2017-?2020, and with the core themes of green, competitive, and inclusive cities of ADB?s Urban Operational Plan.The project will have three outputs: (i) resilient urban infrastructure, public facilities, and social housing units in ger areas constructed (public sector component),  (ii) long-term financing to developers for low-carbon affordable housing, market rate housing, and economic facilities in ger areas and to households for green mortgages increased (financial intermediation loan [FIL] component), and (iii) sector policy reforms implemented and capacity strengthened. Output 1 will deliver (i) green social housing units with climate adaptation and mitigation features, and (ii) resilient infrastructure, public space, and public facilities. Under output 2, up to $75.7 million of the GCF loan will be made available under the proposed FIL to enable an eco-district and affordable housing fund (EDAF) to provide long-term debt financing (denominated in local currency) to eligible commercial banks to support real estate developers? participation in the low-carbon housing market, and produce affordable green mortgages. Output 3 will support (i) project implementation, (ii) eco-district feasibility and development, policy improvement on climate change adaptation and mitigation, and improved supply and access to affordable green housing units, (iii) detailed design and supervision, and (iv) sustainable green housing finance.Eco-district parameters. The project eco-districts will be low-carbon, climate-resilient, mixed-income, and mixed-use areas with approximately 30% public space. The project?s five phases will deliver about 20 eco-districts or subprojects, with each covering an average of 5 ha. Phase 1 include two core subprojects (10 ha) in Bayankhoshuu and Selbe subcenters, phases 2?3 will have 8 subprojects (40 ha), and phases 4?5 will have 10 subprojects (50 ha). Each subproject should be completed within 5 years.  Phases 2?5 will identify and prepare a batch of subprojects to be appraised based on eligibility and selection criteria, including financial and physical parameters, formulated from the feasibility study of the two core subprojects.  A detailed infrastructure and architectural design produced for each subproject will ensure (i) adequate ratio for social (15%), affordable (55%), and market rate (30%) housing units, (ii) balance between public space and amenities, commercial areas, and residential units, and (iii) financial viability and rentability to allow private sector participation. The redevelopment process and housing construction will be undertaken onsite, and will be demand-driven.Sector lending with financial intermediation loan component modality. The sector lending modality was deemed the most appropriate modality to achieve the project objectives because (i) a large number of subprojects in the sector are to be financed, (ii) the government and MUB have sector development plans (SDPs) to ensure the priority development needs of the cross sectoral policy improvement plan are met, and to guide project implementation, (iii) sect",17,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,3

Floods caused landslides and mudslides in Africa and South America. Asia was the worst affected by floods with the deadliest experiences in Pakistan. At one point one-third of the country was underwater with over 33 million people displaced.Beyond the statistics, the situation reveals a particularly fragile state for communities around the world irrespective of the North-South divide. One of the biggest impacts of natural disasters has been on housing. The pandemic experience has already implied the need for quality housing for sustainable and healthy living. In its 2022 report the UK's Regulator of Social Housing has warned of risks and challenges to the affordable housing. In a global context, the housing situation emerges as a wicked problem of development. Unlike tame problems that can be clearly stated, written-down, agreed-upon and solved, wicked problems are difficult to define, contradictory in nature, and tricky to solve since every effort to find a solution leads to another set of challenges. There are many unknown unknowns.Res-House extends the SPRET Network (Frontiers Champions Tranche 2 Grant) that produced an invaluable repository of sustainable zero-energy housing design. The network will be extended to accommodate resilience framework in fragile settings and seek smart, affordable, and sustainable housing solutions. Working at community level adaptation and resilience will allow understanding local needs, empowering communities, and exploring suitable designs, local materials and traditional methods for decent housing respecting the individual and community wellbeing.",11.1,0,,,,0,0,0,0,,,,,0.0124,1

Sida has made an assessment and proposes a 4-year long support (2019-2022), amounting to 275 million SEK. The overarching objective of the intervention is to address the extensive global deficit of affordable and adequate housing and access to basic services such as water and sanitation for people living in poverty. More than one billion people live in informal settlements with substandard access to water and sanitation. By producing affordable houses, the intervention intends to demonstrate that perceived and real obstacles to a functioning sector for affordable housing can be overcome. The intention is that this will attract international and local banks as well as professional building companies and thus catalyse a wider effect. The houses are to be designed to addresses identified blockages to a functioning market for affordable houses and/or bread new grounds in relation to target group, design solutions, financing solutions or other identified needs to systematically address the housing shortage. Dissemination of results and active advocacy efforts to achieve policy development and sustainable financing solutions is to be done continuously. The production of the houses is done by local organisations that are part of Reall's network, through which they receive capacity development support and financing. The local organisations are supported to be able to design and build well planned, affordable and environmentally sustainable houses with a high level of target group participation. Because of lack of other end-user finance alternatives, most of the network organisations provides this service for the target group. Central aspects of the intervention are, -to prove that poor people can and want to finance their own home when the right conditions exist and-to demonstrate that solid work with transparency and a very high level of internal governance and control can make construction processes predictable and reduce the risk of corruption.These two areas are crucial to attract both financiers and other players to the market for low-cost housing.Reall is a non-profit organization based in the UK that supports a network of local organizations. Upon successful assessments, Reall forwards grants to these organisations for functional costs and soft loans for them to build qualitative housing for people with an income between 10-40% on their respective country's income pyramid. The network has presently members in Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Angola, Philippines, Nepal, Pakistan, India, Burkina Faso, Ghana, South Africa, Malawi, Nigeria and Mozambique.Concrete results expected to be generated include 4,000 new adequate and affordable homes, of which an increasing proportion are owned by women or jointly by a man and a woman, as well as an increasing degree of houses adapted for residents with functional variations. The houses are intended to directly contribute to an improved standard of living for 20,000 people. As a side effect of improved infrastructure to these settings, another 2000 households will have access to safe water and / or sanitation.",6.2;6.1;11.c;11.7;11.3;11.1,1,1,1,1,0,,1,0,0,1,0,0.0,0.0,3

Para ello se plantea la construcción de 78 viviendas, haciendo efectivos los derechos de acceso a una vivienda y al saneamiento de 76 mujeres y 2 hombres con discapacidad, incluyéndose como beneficiarios sus respectivos familiares. El presente proyecto pretende abordar dos problemas complementarios: el elevado número de familias empobrecidas queviven en soluciones habitacionales precarias y la práctica de la defecación al aire libre y hábitos de higiene deficientes. Estos dos problemas, aparecen muy a menudo asociados a la marginalidad y la exclusión que sufren las personas que pertenecen a grupos étnicos o castas, socialmente consideradas inferiores. El sistema de castas aparece arraigado en la India, desde hace más de 2.500 años. Este sistema se halla integrado en todos los ámbitos de la sociedad, y clasifica a las personas en función de la etnia, casta o colectivo en el que hayan nacido. De este modo, las familias pertenecientes a colectivos considerados inferiores, como las castas bajas, o los dalits (?sin casta?), afrontan enormes dificultades que impiden su pleno desarrollo humano, económico y social. Entre las dificultades, y como resultado del rechazo que sufren estas personas, nos hallamos con que una parte de la población delpaís reside en alojamientos insalubres e inseguros. Circunstancia que no hace sino fomentar la espiral de pobreza que afecta a estas personas, perpetuando su vulnerabilidad y también su marginalidad.Para paliar esta problemática, el proyecto que se presenta se basa en la entrega de viviendas a 78 familias pertenecientes al colectivo sin casta o de castas bajas, de la comunidad rural de Palthur, ubicada en el distrito de Anantapur, al sur de la India. Con ello, se pretende garantizar el derecho de las familias beneficiarias de disponer una vivienda adecuada, y a residir en unas condiciones de habitabilidad que permitan su desarrollo personal, y su integración en la comunidad. En cuanto alámbito sanitario, la entrega de las viviendas supondrá una reducción sustancial del riesgo de sufrir enfermedades asociadas al hacinamiento, la insalubridad y la inseguridad. En este sentido, las nuevas viviendas que se plantea construir están provistas de las condiciones necesarias de salubridad, constituyendo un resguardo eficaz ante las inclemencias del clima, y proporcionando un ambientefamiliar limpio y digno. El proyecto también trabaja para equilibrar las relaciones de género. Las mujeres en India sufren una fuerte discriminación, intensificada por la pobreza y la casta. El proyecto promueve la participación activa de las mujeres en la paridad, fomentando que se conviertan en las titulares de los derechos a la tierra y la vivienda. A través del acceso y control de los recursos se pretende contribuir aintroducir cambios no solo en las actitudes, sino también en los roles sociales. Al mismo tiempo, se propone la mejora de los niveles de concienciación y conocimiento sobre el derecho al saneamiento, la higiene y las implicaciones de la defecación al aire libre, a través de la sensibilización de las familias beneficiarias y de la población de la comunidad rural de Palthur. El periodo de ejecución del proyecto está previsto que comprenda un total de 12 meses. El inicio de las actividades tendrá lugar en julio de 2023, cuando se proceda con la selección de los trabajadores que participar",11.1,0,1,,0,1,0,1,1,,,0,0.0,0.0216,1

Through a comparative analysis of existing affordable housing models and assessing their sustainability performance, this research proposes to develop a framework for implementing the most sustainable, affordable South African housing model using innovative technologies. The rationale for this research stems from the views held by scholars that the perpetual challenge of providing adequate, affordable housing cannot be solved by traditional methods and techniques. The housing backlog in South Africa is currently estimated at 2.3 million and has been projected to increase as a result of low production rate due to the overt reliance on conventional technologies. The focus to date within the affordable housing domain has been significantly economical, hence not embedding the elemental dynamics of sustainability which is increasingly becoming of great concern, especially the social and environmental components. Therefore, research is needed on the full life-cycle economic, environmental and social impacts on affordable housing, emphasising how to optimise the effects by employing innovative technologies. The study will undertake a systematic literature review to identify the indicators and suitable innovative technologies for enabling sustainable affordable housing. In furtherance to this, it will adopt a mixed-method research methodology involving a juxtaposition of expert interviews and survey of participants to selected affordable housing developments in South Africa. The research data collected will be analysed using analytical techniques to determine sustainability index of conventional methods and innovative technologies and develop a sustainable, affordable housing model for South Africa. It is expected that the study's findings will reveal the potential of innovative technologies to address the challenges encountered in the development of sustainable, affordable housing models within the South African context with opportunities for operationalization in similar developing country contexts.",11.1,0,,,,0,0,0,0,,,,,0.0199,1

Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy sharing is an innovative method to enhance local energy generation and demand balance, and reduce the rural community's reliance on power grid. The P2P energy sharing will provide the additional capacity required for the newly township development, and reduce energy costs for local communities. In order to facilitate the local rural urbanisation and support the business development, our planned research activities include: 1) energy and power demand modelling for new land developments, 2) microgrid and networked microgrid development considering P2P energy sharing, 3) control algorithms for P2P energy sharing to enhance local energy sufficiency and reduce energy costs for consumers, and 4) modern power electronic development to support P2P energy sharing, and energy management of energy storage systems.Modelling and control algorithm design for energy infrastructure using P2P energy sharing method will be carried out considering a vacant land in North West of Pretoria as a case study. For this collaboration, the partners include Dr. Ye from University of Pretoria who is specialised in energy modelling and optimisation for both demand side management and renewable energy integrations, Dr. Hu who is an expert for power electronic device of microgrids and electric vehicles, and Dr. Long whose expertise lies in the P2P energy sharing networks. The urgent energy infrastructure development needs are in line with the business scope of our industry partner Mr. Nyonganyi from Optimal Engineering Solutions in South Africa, and Mr. Stephen Parkinson from Entrust Microgrid in the UK. The responsibilities of the three university partners and two industry partners are well planned considering the roles and expertise to achieve the planned outcomes for teaching, research and innovation.",11.1,0,,,,0,0,0,0,,,,,0.0128,1

The program fosters the needed education and training for future architects and engineers, in order to drive green building adoption. In the considered countries, there is a strong shortage of skilled professionals. Green Buildings bear great potential to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. They contribute to 19% of GHG emissions globally. One important bottleneck in many countries is the lack of skilled architects and engineers needed to increase the inventory of energy efficient buildings. While the previous engagement aimed in a more general way at stimulating the construction of green buildings through standards/green codes and certification systems, the program will now concentrate on skills development only, thereby complement IFC's broader engagement in this field, the so called Market Accelerator for Green Construction.",13;11.1,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,,,3
