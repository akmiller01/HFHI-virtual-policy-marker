"SECURITY DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION WITH BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA IN DEMINING ACTIVITIES - DEMINING MISSION I - EXPERT TRIP (SDC) In April, Czech Police divers carried out a 16 days mission in BiH. The objective of the expert mission was to find and retrieve ammunition from the bottom of the Una River, Krusnica and Crno Lake, in the vicinity of the city of Bosanska Krupa in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and further to deepen the cooperation of the two local civil protection units, FUCZ BiH and RUCZ BiH. Ammunition located at the bottom of Crno Lake and the rivers Una and Krusnice is still a significant security risk for local residents. This is a continuation of the expert missions that Czech police divers have been successfully carrying out since 2011. By carrying out the expert mission, a complete remediation of the terrain of the bottom of the marked sections of water bodies was made.

"LOW ENERGY COOLING AND VENTILATION FOR INDIAN RESIDENCES (LECAVIR) Energy security, climate change and economic growth are matters of critical international importance which are affecting billions of people around the world. The way they are tackled impacts on the sustainable infrastructure of our planet. One of the most significant global development challenges is how we mitigate against the proliferation of energy intensive air-conditioning (AC) for cooling and ventilation in buildings in response to a globally warming world and the greater expectations for thermal comfort in buildings that accompany growing affluence. This is particularly pertinent in developing countries such as India as disposable income increases, making AC more easily accessible. Many of India's most populous metropolitan areas such as Mumbai, Chennai and Calcutta have hot and humid climates, and are seeing growth rates in the use of AC of approximately 30% per year. The electricity demand for space cooling comprises up to 60% of the summer peak load in large cities such as New Delhi, and most air-conditioners are inefficient and use refrigerants with high GWP (global warming potential). A solution to this problem is needed urgently. This makes energy efficiency and thermal comfort a priority area for the Indian government in recent revisions of its National Building and Energy Conservation Building Codes which emphasise the need to design buildings for natural ventilation (NV) and mixed mode (MM) operation. The floor area of Indian buildings is expected to increase by 500% by 2030. Without the knowledge of how to achieve comfortable, cooler conditions through ventilating these new buildings effectively and efficiently, AC will continue to be specified, installed and used copiously. The UK is just as vulnerable to these adverse trends, and similarly needs to address the unsustainable increase in portable AC in homes. This project will develop building designs comprising low energy cooling and ventilation technologies that employ smart self-learning control algorithms to provide countries like India with viable market solutions.  For each climatic zone in India, the project will quantify the periods of the year (or day) for which NV is likely to be feasible. For those periods when NV is unlikely to work, such as hot, humid (monsoon) periods, MM solutions, using a combination of NV, low energy cooling and AC systems will be developed and tested. Although it is inevitable that some AC will be necessary, there is significant scope within this project to work with technologies which are more energy efficient and which use fewer GWP chemicals or eliminate their use altogether. Once the NV and MM strategies are established, the work will focus on developing building energy management systems for controlling these hybrid systems to optimize building energy use. This will involve deciding when to switch between building operation modes, when to start AC systems, and which key variables should be controlled. These algorithms will also have self-lea",43082,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

TRAINING AND SUPPORT FOR URBAN REFUGEES IN KAMPALA The development problem that the project aims to alleviate is poverty defined as lack of certain minimal or basic capacities needed for generating human well-being. The overall objective of the project is to alleviate poverty among the urban refugees in Kampala. The poverty is alleviated through increased self-reliance of beneficiaries which is achieved by building the capacities of participants throught training counselling and supporting refugees income generating activities.  The project has human rights based approach enabling participation of different groups of refugees in the planning and implementation of the project. Special emphasis is put on participation of women and minorities. Training and group discussions will include topics on gender equility human rights and democracy. The improved level of knowledge and skills of the participants will result in increased self-esteem and better capacity to take actively part in the decision making and development activities in their communities. This supports also UNSC Resolution 1325 Women Peace and Security as the knowledge and the skills acquired during refuge will be used also after return contributing towards peace building and reconstruction in the post-conflict areas. The project arranges special counselling and support for the most vulnerable women and girls to improve their well-being and participation in order to reduce the social inequalities. The project is implemented in cooperation with the FRC field staff and refugee associations. Refugee Law Project organises the psycosocial support component. The refugee associations have established the supported learning groups as well as chosen the instructors. The main beneficiaries are the refugees participating in the trainings and other supported activities. Annually 900-1000 refugees - majority of them being women and youth - benefit from the project. 20-30 voluntary instructors who receive training and mentoring are also main beneficiaries. Other beneficiaries are the members of the supported refugee associations and family members of the learning group members and instructors. The key activities are: 1) support to functional adult literacy and English training through mentoring instructor training and learning materails 2) business training and support to IGA 3) Youth training and counselling and support to Youth clubs 4) psychosocial support to women and youth and 5) strengthening the refugee associations by training and mentoring.,11230,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

"FRONTIERS OF ENGINEERING FOR DEVELOPMENT The quality of water for swimming, during Rio Olympic 2016, was discussed several times. Although, for the period of the Olympic, these issues were temporarily resolved but they alarmed Brazilian urban and water managers and planners about their severe water contamination challenges. São Carlos is located on the geographic center of the São Paulo state in Brazil. The city has an active industrial profile with important national and international industries and certain agricultural importance. Due to its increasing number of high technology industries, the city has been proclaimed The National Capital of Technology by Brazilian President in 2011. However, these fast growing urban development, industrialisation and agriculture have caused severe water and environmental contamination in the whole city. On the other hand, lack of efficient and appropriate wastewater treatment system have exacerbated the contamination challenges. These contaminations have put a great risk to the health and wellbeing of the people and aquatic ecosystems. Promotion of resilience to water quality stresses and crises is a necessity in Sao Carlos. This resilience promotion requires development and enhancement of the knowledge and capacities to manage the emerging challenges and risks. Currently, a detailed and integrated map of active and potential contaminators across the city, is lacking.  The long-term vision of this research is to contribute to resilience promotion in Sao Carlos by developing a dynamic information platform for water quality monitoring and assessment. The current research aims to initiate this long-term plan by developing an integrated GIS map of the contaminators and contaminated areas in Sao Carlos. These maps could be used for water quality spatial and temporal analysis. Also, they will enable the local and national decision makers to proactively respond to water contamination across the region. Furthermore, these maps could be used for integrated urban wastewater system asset management plans.",43082,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

"SUPPORTING PARTNERS CONTRIBUTION TO IPCC SPECIAL REPORT ON IMPACTS OF 1.5 DEGREE CELSIUS WARMING In its Paris Agreement, the 21st Conference of Parties (COP 21) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) invited the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to provide a special report in 2018 on the impacts of global warming of 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways. The report will help UNFCC take stock of collective efforts towards holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 C.There is a significant research gap on the nature, benefits and feasibility of a 1.5 C warmer world, and the existing literature does not take a strongly regional or hot-spot approach. However, the Collaborative Adaptation Research Initiative in Africa and Asia's work has the potential to provide strong regional inputs to the 2018 Special Report. CARIAA consortia agreed on a three-phase strategy aimed at producing high-quality, demand-driven peer-reviewed journal articles for consideration by the IPCC special report authors. The resulting project is partially funded though the Opportunities and Synergies Fund, which is a competitive process promoting cross-consortia collaboration within the CARIAA program. A collaboration between the University of Southampton, University of Cape Town, the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development, and the Overseas Development Institute, this project will support the analyses and associated scientific activities aimed at examining consortia results across climate science, biophysical and economic impacts, vulnerability, and policy in light of 1.5 C concerns. Activities include the presentation of research findings at preparatory conferences, participation at a 1.5 C side event at COP22 organized by IDRC and a UNFCCC Party, production of a range of products, including at least 3 peer-reviewed articles on the impacts and implications of 1.5 C versus 2 C warming in each hotspot, a synthesis publication (peer-reviewed for journals or popular magazines) drawing together evidence from hotspots, and policy briefs on 1.5 C for national and regional negotiating groups.The Collaborative Adaptation Research Initiative in Africa and Asia (CARIAA) aims to help build the resilience of poor people to climate change by supporting a network of consortia to conduct high-calibre research and policy engagement in hot spots in Africa and Asia.

Il s'agit de la phase 3 du projet, lors de la phase 1 du projet il a été établi un diagnostique des nappes souterraines dont dépend l'approvisionnement en eau potable (AEP) de Zahlé et a été constitué une base de données recensant les acteurs clés de l'eau et les territoires de dépendance en terme d'AEP. En phase 2, un diagnostic des sols du territoire a été réalisé, ainsi qu'une étude de la vulnérabilité des nappes souteraines et l'identification d'actions phares à mener pour la protection de l'eau (en quantité et qualité) en vue de sécuriser l'eau potable. Depuis 2019 le Liban s'enfonce dans une crise politique et économique. Cet effondrement a été précipité par la pandémie de COVID et l'explosion survenue dans le port de Beyrouth.Les restrictions qui s'appliquent désormais à la population touchent peut à peu le domaine de l'eau avec la disparition des ressources financières des établissement des eaux.Les collectivités locales sont aujourd'hui les dernières structures publiques en capacité d'assurer une politique territoriale cohérente. Ce programme permet de soutenir l'action vers l'eau d'une des principales agglomération de la plaine de la Bekaa.Cette phase 3 se décline en 4 axes :- L'incitation à la pratique de services environnementaux dans l'agriculture en vue de protéger l'eau.- Une capitalisation et une valorisation de l'expérience de coopération entre la Municipalité de Zahlé et de l'Etablissement des Eaux de la Bekaa autour du Schéma Directeur de Zahlé Ville perméable- Une étude prospective des suites pratiques à mener à l'issue de ce projet.- Un volet formation EEDD vers les usagers.Le programme a pour principales activités :1. D'organiser la transition administrative : renouvèlement de la convention, communication sur la clôture de la phase 2 et sur les suites à données, maintien du lien avec les partenaires.2. De mener une enquête autour du nouveau schéma de développement pour l'AEP de Zahlé : CDR, MEE (Ministère de l'Énergie et de l'Eau), EEB (Établissement des Eaux Beyrouth Mont Liban), municipalité de Zahlé:a. identifier les modalités décisionnelles et les éléments techniques qui ont permis de décider la réalisation des différents forages.

The initiative is an integral part of UCLG  s Strategic Plan 2016-2022.  UCLG is a global membership-based organization for municipalities, regional authorities and cities and gathers actors in over 120 countries in all of the world's regions. UCLG supports partnerships and collaborations between members and engages in extensive advocacy in international contexts. A guiding principle for UCLG  s work is that decentralization and strengthening of local capacity are of central importance for sustainable development. The long-term priorities are defined in UCLG's Strategic Priorities 2016-2022, which particularly emphasizes the importance of local ownership and that the contributions of municipalities and cities towards the realization of Agenda 2030 need to be adapted to local conditions and needs. UCLG has established partnerships with several multilateral and bilateral actors, including the EU, which is the largest donor on the basis of a multi-year strategic partnership.  As an integral facet of UCLG  s strategy, Local4Action Hub is a facility to support and catalyse action-oriented implementation in line with the strategy  s overal goal to strengthening the role of cities and municipalities in influencing, implementing and monitoring the global development agendas. The cooperation with Sida is designed as a program support for this facility and thereby aims to scale up prioritized activities related to advocacy, policy, knowledge management and various operations (incl. decentralised cooperation and municipal peer-exchange) aimed at strengthening members' capacity to implement Agenda 2030 at local level. The initiative intends to build the capacity of local governments to address poverty, exclusion and gender inequality. The work plan draws to a large extent on the needs and priorities identified by UCLG  s members, with specific focus on SDG 11 but with bearing on the SDG-agenda at large. Themes and areas that may be addressed within specific activities include, for instance, climate adaptation, housing and basic services delivery, resilience and DRR, integrated urban planning, local economic development, migration, women  s representation in policy- and decision-making processes, etc. UCLG's World Secretariat based in Barcelona will lead the implementation of theinitiative, whereas the geographical sections (i.e., UCLG-Asia Pacific, UCLG Africa) will be involved in key activities through sub-granting arrangements.",15112,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

"STRENGTHENING THE CAPACITY OF AUDITORS IN CUBA/RENFORCER LA CAPACITÉ DES VÉRIFICATEURS À CUBA This project aims to strengthen public accountability in Cuba by helping to build efficient, transparent public financial management systems at a time when Cuba is decentralising and introducing economic reforms. The initiative will draw on best Canadian and international practice to train auditors across Cuba to international standards, enabling their contribution to increased institutional accountability and reduced risk arising from corruption./Ce projet vise à renforcer l'obligation de rendre des comptes au public à Cuba en améliorant la capacité du gouvernement cubain à établir une gouvernance financière et économique transparente. L'ACDI contribue à un projet mis en œuvre par Cowater International, en mettant en place des approches et des techniques de vérification modernes fondées sur des modèles canadiens et internationaux. Le projet appuiera la décentralisation de la fonction de vérification dans l'ensemble de Cuba pour en accroître l'efficacité. Dans le cadre du projet, on cherche à former un nouveau groupe de vérificateurs conformément aux normes internationales pour permettre à celui-ci de contribuer de manière importante au renforcement de la responsabilisation institutionnelle au pays. Une plus grande reddition de comptes financiers au public est essentielle pour réduire le risque de fraude et de corruption pendant la réforme économique de Cuba, qui fera passer le pays d'un contrôle centralisé à une plus grande libéralisation. Parmi les principales activités du projet : i) fournir une formation pratique et théorique (cours, ateliers et conférences) à des vérificateurs du Système de vérification national en matière de méthodes de vérification et de pratiques de supervision et de contrôle, ii) fournir une formation et une assistance technique au Bureau du contrôleur général de Cuba et à ses vérificateurs pour les accréditer selon les normes internationales.",15110,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Una de las barreras es ocasionada por las largas distancias entre los domicilios y el centro docente. Este recorrido diario supone un riesgo de ser violadas o abusadas sexualmente, además del tiempo que se emplea en el recorrido. Ante esta situación los padres optan por sus hijos varones para que accedan a la educación y las niñas se quedan en casa. Para facilitar el acceso a la educación en igualdad de condiciones se plantea la construcción de esta residencia femenina (finalización) y Sala de usos múltiples para actividades de cooperación, teatro, cine, fiestas.,. Madaba es una población rural de 7.030 habitantes distribuida en 6 localidades donde se ubican 6 escuelas de primaria y 2 escuelas de secundaria.

It has showed an immense potential to provide alternative livelihood and reduce poverty, especially among women. Yet, for endorsing its expected expansion, further development is needed to ensure sustainable farming practices, increase production and mitigated environmental impact. The aim of the proposed project is to increase farming outcome by replacing the present ecologically unsustain use of non-indigenous Asian strains of the economically important Eucheuma and Kappaphycus, with vigorous native ones. By mapping wild seaweed populations, their performance and adaptive capacity to climate change, strains suitable for commercial cultivation will be identified and tested. Further will the potential need for management practices and rehabilitation of denuded seaweed beds for maintained ecosystem diversity and function be investigated. The project will also promote local capacity for farming development and the scientific collaboration between Sweden and East Africa. Both molecular and more traditional techniques will be used. AFLP, a well-established DNA-fingerprinting method, will identify individual strains and reveal their population structure.

"IUCN NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS FOR RESILIENT COMMUNITIES IN THE WESTERN BALKANS - NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS FOR RESILIENT COMMUNITIES IN THE WESTERN BALKANS The ADAPT: Nature-based Solutions for Resilient Societies in the Western Balkan project aims to demonstrate how nature based solutions can complement engineering solutions in disaster risk reduction. The project will identify solutions on how nature can improve, water security, food security, solutions for disaster risk reduction, and solutions for climate adaptation in Western Balkan with pilots in Albania and Serbia and assessments in BiH, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Kosovo.The 2016 European Environment Agency report on climate change, impacts and vulnerability in Europe considers south-eastern and southern Europe as highly prone to climate change effects, being a region with the highest impact of climate change and number of severely affected sectors and domains in Europe. The Ministerial Declaration of the 2nd High-Level Panel on the Environment and Climate Action in the Western Balkans, endorsed at the 2017 Bonn Climate Conference, recognized climate challenges as one of the priorities for action in the region. This reinforces the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that also identified the Western Balkans as one of the most vulnerable areas to the effects of climate change. The Bonn declaration calls on the governments to take a more coordinated approach to existing initiatives and projects in the region, in terms of policy integration, capacity development, and action on the ground, as there is no evidence that such a coordinated action has taken place to date.The 2005 Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, itself is a product of this growing awareness, provided a strong evidence base for subsequent policies to promote the conservation, restoration and sustainable management of ecosystems while also taking into account the increasing demands placed on ecosystem services (MillenniumEcosystem Assessment, 2005). The Millennium ecosystem assessment report, in fact,  marked a new way of thinking recognizing that infrastructure alone is increasingly unlikely to provide future water security, sustainable agriculture and sustainable urban development. Western Balkan has experienced an increased frequency in floods, extended periods of drought, soil erosion and forest fires, frequently turning into natural disasters, with communities and societies at large being affected in both the short- and long-term. Severe floods in BiH and Serbia in 2014 resulted in several dozens of casualties, causing the destruction of public and private infrastructures, as well as hitting hundreds of thousands of households, many of whom, mostly vulnerable groups had to rely on humanitarian assistance. Nature-based solutions (NBS) is a newly coined umbrella concept (Albert et al., 2017). It relates to the use of nature for addressing a range of global environmental and social challenges, such as climate change and pollution of water systems (Cohen-Shacham et al., 2016).

The funding to Action Against Hunger (AAH) in 202, which is encompassed in decision nr 2022-001383, is based on the Sida humanitarian allocation process that took place in late 2021 and 2022. The current decision concerns a financial contribution to AAH amounting to 411,5 MSEK.The following modality of support is financed:1. Country Programmes/annual projects in 20 countries â€ 348,5 MSEK,2. Rapid Response Mechanism - 50 MSEK,3. Capacity Building Support â€ 8 MSEK,4. Method Support â€ 5 MSEK.During 2022 the programme and project support covers the following 20 countries/crises: Burkina Faso, Central African Republic, Chad, Colombia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Haiti, Iraq, Kenya, Lebanon, Madr, Niger, Nigeria, Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan, Syria, Uganda, Ukraine and Venezuela. Five countries have multi-year funding during the period 2022-2024, namely: Chad, Ethiopia, Somalia, South Sudan and Syria. The project and country programmes includes support to the sectors of nutrition, protection, food security, health, livelihood, shelter, GBV and WASH.Through their work, AAH contributes towards enabling access of disaster affected populations to essential services such as prevention and treatment of major childhood illnesses (e.g. measles, diarrhoea), improving infant and young child feeding practices, and treatment of acute malnutrition among children and mothers through the provision of supplementary and therapeutic foods. The intervention is therefore assessed to contribute to Reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health (RMNCH). Furthermore, gender equality is a cross-cutting perspective in the interventions and is taken into consideration through: gender analysis that inform the programme/project design, interventions adopt a â€œdo no harmâ€ approach by e.g. targeting both displaced populations and host communities, results frameworks incorporate gender-specific indicators and disaggregated data, and monitoring of AAHâ€™s Gender Equality Policy (approved 2021). In all contexts, complaints and response mechanisms are established through which any cases of misconduct or Sexual Exploitation, Abuse and Harassment (SEAH) are reported. Background:AAH is a non-profit organisation, previously known as Action Contre La Faim (ACF), which is governed by the French Association Law of July 1, 1901. AAH was established in 1979 specifically to respond to humanitarian emergencies, focusing on issues of malnutrition.AAH international network (AAH-IN) is composed of AAH entities from France, (Sida agreement partner), AAH India, AAH United Kingdom, AAH Spain, AAH USA and AAH Canada. Each of these members are separate legal entities, but share a common charter of principles, strategy and areas of intervention. All members of the network are committed to bringing coherence and enhancing efficiency to better serve those in need of nourishment , and to adhere to the AAH principles for which it stands. These principles are: moral and financial independence, strict political and religious neutrality, non-discrimination, free and direct access to victims, professionalism and transparency. The principles are outlined in an agreement (the International Global Protocols), which is signed by all AAH members.",72010,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"THE GREAT LAKES AND CENTRAL AFRICA REGION - EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE - UNHCR APPEAL 2015 / LA RÉGION DES GRANDS LACS ET AFRIQUE CENTRALE - ASSISTANCE D'UR March 2015 - Over the course of 2014, the Central Africa and Great Lakes region was impacted by ongoing conflicts and insecurity in the Central African Republic (CAR) and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), as well as by the outbreak of the civil war in South Sudan. Each of these situations has led to large scale displacement of populations both internally and across national borders. Overall, across this region, there are now almost 1 million refugees. Food insecurity, particularly in the CAR and DRC, is widespread and child malnutrition rates remain alarmingly high. In total, more than 10 million people across the region are expected to require humanitarian assistance in 2015.   With the support of DFATD and other donors, UNHCR is contributing to improved living conditions for up to 1.6 million refugees, returnees, internally displaced persons and other vulnerable people in Burundi, Central African Republic, Republic of Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda, and Tanzania. Project activities include: (1) providing registration, identification documentation, and protection monitoring for refugees and IDPs, (2) promoting the prevention of, and rapid response to, sexual and gender-based violence through training and community sensitization campaigns, (3) addressing the basic needs of refugees and IDPs through the provision of health care, water and sanitation, education, and protection services, (4) providing livelihood supplies, equipment, and training to refugees to enhance livelihood opportunities and self-resilience, and (5) providing emergency shelter, basic household items, and rehabilitating infrastructure benefiting refugee and displaced populations. / Mars 2015 - Durant l'année 2014, l'Afrique centrale et la région des Grands Lacs étaient touchées par l'insécurité et les conflits qui perdurent en République centrafricaine et en République démocratique du Congo, ainsi que par l'éclatement de la guerre civile au Soudan du Sud.

"PREVENTION OF SEVERE RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS AMONG CHILDREN BELOW 5 YEARS IN ETHIOPIA. Pneumococcal infections are the leading cause of death among children below 5 year worldwide.Ethiopia is among the 10 countries with the highest disease burden. A pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) has given to all children in Ethiopia since 2011, but the effect on the disease is not known. The good response seen in USA and Europa may not be repeated because of diferences in serotype distribution and virulence among strains of some serotypes. We plan to investigate the serotype distribution and resistance among pneumococci from children with clinical infections and asymptomatic carriers. Clinical data and level of antibiotic resistance will be related to the serotypes in available vaccines. Indoor air pollution has been found to be a leading cause of morbidity where the food is cooked on open fire with insufficient ventilation. The children in the houses are exposed to smoke, which is likely to be a risk factor for respiratory infections. The air quality will be determined by measuring the carbon monoxide (CO) concentration since CO is a known tracer of incomplete combustion. However, the relation between carbon monoxide levels, airway inflammation and bacteriology in children has not been studied. 100 children living in homes where the food is cooked indoors on open fire without chimney will be compared with 100 children from homes with other forms of cooking.

"WATER AND SANITATION FOR THE URBAN POOR (WSUP) Summary: Most people living in the peri-urban areas of Lusaka use a latrine for sanitation, often a covered pit latrine shared with a number of households. Many of these latrines are full because they cannot easily be emptied or relocated. When annual flooding occurs pits overflow leading to highly unsanitary conditions and a high incidence of disease and illness. This project has identified an innovative approach to faecal sludge management which addresses critical barriers in the sanitation chain the capture, transport, treatment and potential re-use of waste from pit latrines in a safe and sustainable way. As part of this pilot project, teams of pit latrine emptiers will be trained to ensure that waste is being safely transported and treated and awareness raising campaigns will take place in the communities to ensure there is an uptake of these improved services. The proposed project will seek to scale up the outreach and efficiency of the service being provided, further develop and test the way in which the service can be delivered better, and establish a basis for larger scale replication across informal settlements in Lusaka and other cities. This is an ambitious but exciting project which provides an opportunity to support the development and delivery of an important and basic service that could impact on many thousands of households living in Lusakas peri urban settlements. Learning from the project could also have relevance for interventions in other cities.

"ACCESS TO THE RIGHT TO DECENT HOUSING WITH ADEQUATE SANITATION FROM A GENDER PERSPECTIVE FOR 78 FAMILIES BELONGING TO THE MOST Acceso al derecho de una vivienda digna con saneamiento adecuado desde una perspectiva de género para 78 familias pertenecientes a los colectivos más empobrecidos de la comunidad rural de Palthur, Distrito de Anatapur, India. :: En consonancia con los objetivos de la Agenda 2030 de Naciones Unidas y las Políticas del Gobierno de la India, el presente proyecto pretende crear un asentamiento humano inclusivo, digno y seguro en la comunidad rural de Palthur, distrito de Anantapur, para familias pertenecientes al colectivo sin casta y alas castas más desfavorecidas de la India. Para ello se plantea la construcción de 78 viviendas, haciendo efectivos los derechos de acceso a una vivienda y al saneamiento de 76 mujeres y 2 hombres con discapacidad, incluyéndose como beneficiarios sus respectivos familiares. El presente proyecto pretende abordar dos problemas complementarios: el elevado número de familias empobrecidas queviven en soluciones habitacionales precarias y la práctica de la defecación al aire libre y hábitos de higiene deficientes. Estos dos problemas, aparecen muy a menudo asociados a la marginalidad y la exclusión que sufren las personas que pertenecen a grupos étnicos o castas, socialmente consideradas inferiores. El sistema de castas aparece arraigado en la India, desde hace más de 2.500 años. Este sistema se halla integrado en todos los ámbitos de la sociedad, y clasifica a las personas en función de la etnia, casta o colectivo en el que hayan nacido. De este modo, las familias pertenecientes a colectivos considerados inferiores, como las castas bajas, o los dalits (?sin casta?), afrontan enormes dificultades que impiden su pleno desarrollo humano, económico y social. Entre las dificultades, y como resultado del rechazo que sufren estas personas, nos hallamos con que una parte de la población delpaís reside en alojamientos insalubres e inseguros. Circunstancia que no hace sino fomentar la espiral de pobreza que afecta a estas personas, perpetuando su vulnerabilidad y también su marginalidad.Para paliar esta problemática, el proyecto que se presenta se basa en la entrega de viviendas a 78 familias pertenecientes al colectivo sin casta o de castas bajas, de la comunidad rural de Palthur, ubicada en el distrito de Anantapur, al sur de la India. Con ello, se pretende garantizar el derecho de las familias beneficiarias de disponer una vivienda adecuada, y a residir en unas condiciones de habitabilidad que permitan su desarrollo personal, y su integración en la comunidad. En cuanto alámbito sanitario, la entrega de las viviendas supondrá una reducción sustancial del riesgo de sufrir enfermedades asociadas al hacinamiento, la insalubridad y la inseguridad. En este sentido, las nuevas viviendas que se plantea construir están provistas de las condiciones necesarias de salubridad, constituyendo un resguardo eficaz ante las inclemencias del clima, y proporcionando un ambientefamiliar limpio y digno. El proyecto también trabaja para equilibrar las relaciones de género. Las mujeres en India sufren una fuerte discriminación, intensificada por la pobreza y la casta. El proyecto promueve la participación activa de las mujeres en la paridad, fomentando que se conviertan en las titulares de los derechos a la tierra y la vivienda. A través del acceso y control de los recursos se pretende contribuir aintroducir cambios no solo en las actitudes, sino también en los roles sociales. Al mismo tiempo, se propone la mejora de los niveles de concienciación y conocimiento sobre el derecho al saneamiento, la higiene y las implicaciones de la defecación al aire libre, a través de la sensibilización de las familias beneficiarias y de la población de la comunidad rural de Palthur. El periodo de ejecución del proyecto está previsto que comprenda un total de 12 meses. El inicio de las actividades tendrá lugar en julio de 2023, cuando se proceda con la selección de los trabajadores que participar",16040,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1

A surge in violent conflict and inter-communal tensions erupted in previously peaceful areas and intensified in others in 2017, forcing millions to flee their homes, bringing the total number of internally displaced people in the country to 4.49 million and severely stretching the humanitarian community's capacity to respond. Across the DRC, at least 13.1 million people require humanitarian assistance - an increase of 79% from the start of 2017.  This includes 7.7 million severely food insecure people and close to 2 million severely malnourished children.With GAC's support, Solidarites International is providing assistance to address the urgent needs of up to 38,750 conflict-affected people in Kasaï Oriental, Lomami and Sankuru provinces, DRC. This project focuses on increasing access to safe water and sanitation facilities, non-food items and livelihood support for conflict affected populations. Project activities include:(1) providing up to 5,000 households with tools and/or seeds to improve livelihoods,(2) providing up to 1,500 households with access to NFIs,(3) rehabilitate up to 5 water points and adding chlorination to up to 55 water points, and(4) providing hygiene sessions to up to 8,250  people. / Février 2018 – La situation humanitaire en République démocratique du Congo (RDC) s'est détériorée à un rythme alarmant depuis 2016. Les affrontements violents et les tensions intercommunautaires ont éclaté dans des zones précédemment pacifiques et se sont intensifiées dans d'autres en 2017, portant ainsi à 4,49 millions le nombre total de personnes déplacées à l'intérieur du pays et mettant à mal considérablement la capacité d'intervention de la communauté humanitaire. Dans l'ensemble de la RDC, au moins 13,1 millions de personnes ont besoin d'aide humanitaire  — une augmentation de 79 % depuis le début de 2017. Cela inclut 7,7 millions de  personnes souffrant d'insécurité alimentaire grave et près de 2 millions d'enfants gravement sous-alimentés.Avec le soutien d'AMC, Solidarités International offre une aide pour répondre aux besoins urgents de jusqu'à 38 750 personnes touchées par des conflits dans les provinces du Kasaï-Oriental, du Lomami et du Sankuru, en RDC.
