"FIGHT FOR PEACE INTERNATIONAL Primary goal (Comic Relief): Children and young people at risk. Related issues (Comic Relief): NULL. Summary: In Mare favela, one of the most dangerous slums in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, drug-related gun violence is the primary cause of death of young people. Key drivers for youth participation in crime and violence include poverty, low levels of education, social marginalisation, violence from state forces and armed groups, dysfunctional families, and a lack of leisure facilities. This project will extend a tried and tested approach that offers personal development, sports, education and employment opportunities and social support services to vulnerable young people in the favela, enabling young people to realise their full potential and increasing social cohesion and peace in the target communities.

Analyzing the text against the provided definitions:
- Housing: No explicit mention of housing-related activities such as construction, provision, upgrading, policy, services, technical assistance, or finance related to housing is made in the description. Therefore, this class does not apply.
- Homelessness: There are no references to tents, encampments for the homeless, or homeless shelters within the text. This class is not applicable.
- Transitional: The project does not mention emergency shelters, refugee camps, or temporary supportive housing. Thus, transitional is not a match.
- Incremental: Although there is an emphasis on training and development of services, there are no explicit references to activities such as slum upgrading, housing structural repairs, or neighborhood integration. This class doesn't apply.
- Social: There is no mention of community land trusts, cooperative housing, or public housing within the text, so social does not match.
- Market: The focus on enhancing economic potential through tourism and training local businesses aligns with market-related activities such as supporting home-rental services, mortgages, rent-to-own housing, or general business development. However, it's indirect; therefore, it is somewhat tangential but can be considered related to the broader market class.
- Urban: While there are no explicit mentions of specific urban locations, the project targets a region (Imereťi), which includes Kutaisi, the largest city in that area, implying an urban context. Thus, urban may apply given the regional development focus and involvement of a major city.
- Rural: The description refers to exploiting natural attractions and landmarks within the Imereťi region, suggesting rural elements could be involved, though not explicitly stated as such. However, it does not specifically mention activities in rural locations per se, making this class less applicable than urban but still relevant due to regional context.",False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False

The text also addresses land adjustments, which might relate to the provision of land for housing purposes, a component often associated with both incremental approaches (like slum upgrading) and social strategies (such as community land trusts).

The text mentions the construction of houses specifically aimed at 'familias pobres' in Southern India, which aligns with providing housing solutions. This suggests a direct involvement in creating living spaces rather than addressing homelessness or transitional needs such as emergency shelters. There is no mention of homeless shelters, tents for the homeless, or similar facilities, thus excluding the 'Homelessness' class.

The project involves constructing 15 houses, which fits into the 'Housing' category as it explicitly describes construction of housing. The focus on poor families and the specific geographic reference to southern India, particularly a rural area ('taluk'), might also bring 'Rural' into consideration.

There is no mention of slum upgrading or neighborhood integration, eliminating the possibility for the 'Incremental' classification. Similarly, there's no indication that this involves cooperative housing, community land trusts, or public housing projects, which rules out 'Social'.

The description does not touch upon any aspects related to market-rate housing like mortgages or rent-to-own housing schemes; therefore, it cannot be classified as 'Market'. There is no mention of urban areas in the project title or description either, ruling out the 'Urban' classification. The lack of references to temporary facilities for displaced individuals implies that this isn't about transitional accommodations.

Overall, the text primarily focuses on constructing housing with a specific rural location, which means 'Housing' and 'Rural' are most appropriate classifications.",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True

The focus is on improving their medical and humanitarian situation by providing quality medical assistance, especially prioritizing vulnerable migrant populations and extending care to migrants at transit stations, asylum seekers, and those who do not stay in shelters. Here's the analysis with respect to each class:

- **Housing**: Although there is mention of 'albergues' (shelters), the primary focus is on medical assistance rather than housing provision.
- **Homelessness**: The text does not specifically address homeless shelters or encampments for the homeless, but mentions people who do not use shelters.
- **Transitional**: There is a clear emphasis on assisting migrants and asylum seekers, which aligns with transitional support such as temporary supportive housing, albeit indirectly. However, it focuses more on medical aid than shelter itself.
- **Incremental**: The text does not discuss housing sites, technical assistance for housing, slum upgrading, structural repairs, or neighborhood integration.
- **Social**: There is no explicit mention of community land trusts, cooperative housing, or public housing initiatives.
- **Market**: No reference to market-rate housing, home-rentals, mortgages, or rent-to-own housing solutions.
- **Urban**: The text does not specify whether the activities are taking place in urban locations.
- **Rural**: Similar to urban, there is no specific mention of rural settings for these activities.

This text clearly deals with improving existing housing conditions and infrastructure, which falls under several relevant categories. The primary focus is on upgrading inadequate housing by studying and implementing enhancements. It also implies technical assistance in understanding local construction methods to propose viable solutions. The specific mention of 'viviendas autoconstruidas' (self-constructed houses) suggests a community-driven approach typical of incremental improvements, which often involve gradual upgrades based on available resources and techniques.

The key components of this description include:

1. **International Cooperation in Migration**: This suggests an overarching framework aimed at handling migration issues.
2. **Federal Office for Migration (FOM)**: Indicates the involvement of governmental bodies focusing on migration policies and interests, primarily returning asylum seekers to their countries of origin.
3. **Shelter for Syrian IDPs (Internally Displaced Persons)**: This implies providing temporary accommodations or emergency shelters, suggesting an immediate need rather than permanent solutions.
4. **Urban Services**: The term 'urban' indicates that the activities are taking place in urban areas.

Considering these components:
- The mention of shelter aligns with both 'Transitional' (emergency shelters) and 'Housing', particularly if it involves provision or upgrading of temporary accommodation for displaced persons.
- Since the program is directed at Syrian IDPs, which includes providing emergency or transitional shelters, this fits well under the 'Transitional' class.
- The term 'Urban Services' clearly aligns with activities occurring in urban settings, indicating that these services are implemented specifically in cities or towns.

1. **Housing**: The mention of 'providing shelter' for the homeless suggests an element of housing.
2. **Homelessness**: Explicitly mentions 'homeless of Delhi', indicating a focus on homelessness.
3. **Transitional**: Involves providing shelters, which can be considered transitional as they offer temporary support and assistance to the homeless population.

It outlines specific activities such as rehabilitating water tanks and systems, distributing hygiene kits, constructing sanitation facilities, and training in basic hygiene practices. The initiative aims to improve living conditions for those affected by the ongoing armed conflict and displacement issues.

Given the descriptions provided, several potential classifications could be considered:

1. **Housing**: While not directly about housing construction or policy, providing water systems and sanitation can be part of improving inadequate housing conditions. However, the text does not explicitly mention housing provision or upgrading.
   
2. **Homelessness**: The project is focused on displaced people but does not specifically address tents for the homeless, encampments, or homeless shelters.

3. **Transitional**: This could be relevant as the activities are directed towards crisis-affected people who may need transitional support until more permanent solutions can be found. Emergency shelters and temporary housing might fall under this category if they were mentioned, but they are not explicitly referred to here.
   
4. **Incremental**: The project includes rehabilitation of existing water tanks, systems, and construction of basic sanitation facilities, which aligns with incremental improvements in living conditions through gradual enhancements and repairs.

5. **Social**: There is no specific mention of community land trusts or cooperative housing models, so this classification seems less applicable.

6. **Market**: The project does not engage with home rental, mortgages, rent-to-own, or market-rate housing solutions, making this classification inapplicable.

7. **Urban**: Although the activities are specified for the Nariño department, there is no explicit mention that these efforts focus specifically on urban areas, so this classification isn't directly applicable.

8. **Rural**: The project includes health care services in rural areas and addresses basic needs for crisis-affected populations which may include rural settings; however, it's not explicitly stated to be solely targeting rural locations.

Overall, the most relevant classifications appear to focus on transitional and incremental improvements given the context of humanitarian aid for displaced people in a conflict setting.",False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False

The key terms here are 'housing reconstruction' and 'evaluation,' suggesting a focus on the effectiveness of efforts to provide or improve housing. Housing reconstruction implies activities such as constructing new homes or upgrading existing ones, which aligns with the definition provided for the 'Housing' class.

Given that these programs were implemented in Sri Lanka, it's important to consider whether the location is urban or rural. However, the text does not explicitly specify urban or rural settings; instead, it focuses on a national program without detailing specific locations.

The mention of capacity building aligns with providing technical assistance and support for improving housing-related activities, which can further relate to 'Housing'.

No explicit mentions of homelessness, transitional shelters, incremental improvements, social housing models like community land trusts or cooperative housing, market-specific housing types like home-rental or mortgages, or specific urban or rural locations were identified.

Het militaire partnerschap met de Democratische Republiek Congo omvat vooral de vorming van, toezicht op en evaluatie van een 'URR' brigade (Unité de Réaction Rapide  - een soort paracommando's) bestaande uit drie elite bataljons (321e, 322e en 323e Bataillons de Réaction Rapide) te Kindu, naast de vorming, de begeleiding en evaluatie van de onderrichters van de Militaire Academie van Kananga en van de Genieschool in Likasi. Het 321e bataljon werd eind 2008-begin 2009 gevormd te Kananga, het 322e bataljon eind 2011-begin 2012 te Kindu en tenslotte het 323e bataljon in de loop van 2013 te Kindu. Blijft nog de vorming van de staf van de brigade die de drie gevormde elite bataljons zal omkaderen. Wanneer een militair in de Democratische Republiek Congo een standplaats krijgt toegewezen om er tijdelijk te verblijven, trekt zijn gezin bijna altijd mee. Deze verplaatsingen resulteren vaak in moeilijke levensomstandigheden voor de families. Die families dienen op zoek te gaan naar een onderkomen, naar gezondheidszorgen, naar een school voor hun kinderen en naar landbouwgrond om voedsel te kunnen produceren. Dit gebeurt vaak ten koste van de lokale populatie met conflicten als gevolg. Om aan deze tendens een halt toe te roepen, willen de Congolese regering en de Stafdienst van het leger (FARDC – Forces Armées de la République Démocratique du Congo) de militairen en hun gezin een vaste woonplaats bezorgen. Het is de bedoeling de militairen te huisvesten in garnizoensteden verspreid over het hele land. Zo zullen de militairen die op missie vertrekken, gerust gesteld zijn dat hun familie veilig en degelijk gehuisvest is.Kindu gelegen in de provincie Maniema is één van die garnizoensteden.

1. **Shelter**: The text explicitly mentions 'shelter' as part of the response to natural disasters and conflict, aligning with the definition for 'Housing'. This is a direct provision of housing-related support.

2. **Transitional**: Given that this program covers both immediate relief and early recovery interventions, it suggests temporary housing solutions like emergency shelters or temporary supportive housing could be involved in the response to natural disasters and conflict.

- **Housing:** The text mentions 'building smoke oven shelters,' which implies construction of shelter. This aligns with the housing category that includes construction of housing and provision of shelter in emergencies.

- **Homelessness:** There is no explicit mention of tents, encampments, or homeless shelters specifically for the homeless, so this class does not apply.

- **Transitional:** The text does not explicitly describe emergency shelters, refugee shelters, camps, or temporary supportive housing. Therefore, it doesn't match this category.

- **Incremental:** While the building of shelters might suggest incremental improvements in living conditions, there is no explicit mention of terms like 'housing sites,' 'housing services,' 'structural repairs,' or 'neighborhood integration.' Thus, this class does not apply directly.

- **Social:** There is no reference to community land trusts, cooperative housing, or public housing. Therefore, this category does not match.

- **Market:** The text doesn't describe any market-related activities like home-rental, mortgages, rent-to-own housing, or market-rate housing, so it doesn't fall under this class.

- **Urban:** There is no explicit mention of specific urban locations where these activities are taking place. Therefore, the urban category does not apply.

- **Rural:** Similarly, there is no direct reference to specific rural locations, even though Sierra Leone has rural areas. The lack of specificity makes it challenging to classify under this category without additional context.

3. **Geographical Context**: The activities are situated in Costa Rica, which is an urban area compared to rural settings. This could potentially align with the 'Urban' class due to the location being a country's capital region where such organizations typically operate.

4. **Other Considerations**: There is no explicit mention of direct housing provision, homelessness shelters, or any specific rural activities in the description. The text does not describe market-rate housing or slum upgrading specifically either.

1. **Housing:** The text mentions establishing shelters for survivors but does not explicitly describe activities related to housing provision, upgrading inadequate housing, or construction of housing. Hence, it doesn't fit under 'Housing'.

2. **Homelessness:** Although shelters are mentioned, they are specified as a re-integration measure rather than being used for tents, encampments, or homeless shelters explicitly. So, it does not match the definition of 'Homelessness'.

3. **Transitional:** The text mentions establishing shelters for trafficked children survivors which could be interpreted as temporary supportive housing. Therefore, this aligns with the definition of 'Transitional' as it involves emergency shelters.

4. **Incremental:** There is no mention of housing sites, services, technical assistance, slum upgrading, or neighborhood integration in the text. Thus, it doesn't fit under 'Incremental'.

5. **Social:** The description does not explicitly refer to community land trusts, cooperative housing, or public housing. So, it does not match 'Social'.

6. **Market:** There are no references to home-rentals, mortgages, rent-to-own housing, or market-rate housing in the text. Thus, it doesn't fit under 'Market'.

7. **Urban:** The text doesn’t specify activities occurring in urban locations. So, it does not match 'Urban'.

8. **Rural:** Similarly, there is no explicit mention of rural locations where the activities are carried out. Therefore, it doesn't match 'Rural'.

The text describes a children's home in Kathmandu, Nepal, which provides accommodation and meals, ensuring a healthy environment for 15 boys and 15 girls aged between 7 to 21. This aligns well with the 'Housing' class as it involves providing housing (accommodation) in a structured setting. The emphasis on creating an environment that supports harmonious growth also fits within this category since it touches upon enhancing living conditions, which can be seen as upgrading inadequate conditions for those residing there.

Furthermore, the project is specifically located in Kathmandu, an urban area, which aligns with the 'Urban' class. The description does not mention temporary or transitional housing solutions like emergency shelters or refugee camps; hence, it doesn't fit into the 'Transitional' class. Similarly, there's no explicit mention of incremental improvements such as slum upgrading or structural repairs, so it does not directly fall under the 'Incremental' class.

The project also mentions ensuring education and fostering resilience among children, which indicates a broader social welfare aim but doesn't explicitly fit into categories like 'Social,' unless one argues that providing a stable home environment aligns with community-oriented housing support. However, this connection is more tangential than explicit in the description.

There are no references to homelessness situations (tents or shelters for homeless), so it does not match the 'Homelessness' class. It also doesn't mention social structures like cooperatives or public housing, making a fit with the 'Social' class less direct.

Finally, since Kathmandu is an urban setting and there are no indications of rural activities or market-driven solutions like mortgages or home-rental schemes, it does not align with 'Rural' or 'Market.'",True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False

Una mirada palestina al valle del Jordán :: Desde 1948 el Estado de Israel inició la Nakba, un proceso de desplazamiento forzoso y violento de la población palestina de sus lugares de origen. Esta estrategia que se manifiesta de diferentes maneras (sistema de permisos, zonificación, segregación, confiscación de tierras, denegación de acceso a recursos y servicios, supresión de la resistencia, debilitamiento de la identidad, entre otras) busca el debilitamiento de la identidad nacional y la resistencia colectiva, afectando especialmente el relevo generacional y los mecanismos de resistencia comunitarios. El desplazamiento interno y refugio de la población palestina ha condicionado su acceso a servicios básicos y medios de vida ante la dependencia del mercado de trabajo israelí y la ayuda humanitaria en los campamentos de refugiados. Adicionalmente, su sociedad es ampliamente conservadora y patriarcal, lo cual relega a los jóvenes y mujeres a un segundo plano. Se estima que casi el 30% de la población palestina es joven (15-29 años), pese al alto nivel de alfabetización la juventud debe hacer frente a altas tasas de desempleo (40%), asimismo, las mujeres jóvenes sufren con frecuencia un contexto doblemente opresor de sus derechos y libertades que les impide implicarse y participar en la lucha por la liberación palestina. El proyecto contará con la participación de 7 organizaciones y tiene como objetivo ?Organizaciones Comunitarias (CBOs) de jóvenes, mujeres, refugiados/as y desplazados/as internos/as fortalecen sus lazos, su identidad y sus estrategias de resistencia colectiva frente a las políticas israelíes de segregación y desposesión?.",15160,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,"The project titled 'BRIDGES AND RESILIENCE.

The key elements here include internal displacement of Palestinians, reliance on humanitarian aid, and focus on strengthening community organizations amidst segregation and dispossession policies by Israel.

1. **Housing**: There is a mention of the population's displacement leading to limited access to basic services, which may relate to inadequate housing, but there is no explicit mention of direct provision or upgrading of housing infrastructure.

2. **Homelessness**: The description does not specify the use of homeless shelters or encampments for the homeless.

3. **Transitional**: The text refers to internal displacement and refugees. This hints at transitional forms of sheltering, such as refugee camps or temporary supportive housing.

4. **Incremental**: There's no direct mention of housing sites, technical assistance, slum upgrading, structural repairs, or neighborhood integration efforts.

5. **Social**: The project involves strengthening community organizations (CBOs), which might include initiatives akin to social housing but isn't explicitly stated.

6. **Market**: No explicit references are made to home-rental, mortgages, rent-to-own housing, or market-rate housing.

7. **Urban**: There's no specific mention of urban locations in the project description; it refers broadly to the Jordan Valley region without specifying whether it's predominantly urban or rural.

8. **Rural**: The Jordan Valley is largely a rural area; hence activities likely occur within rural settings, given the geographic focus of this project on Palestinian communities affected by displacement and policies that affect their land use.

"PROMOTING LEGAL EMPOWERMENT OF THE URBAN POOR IN NIGERIA THROUGH AN INTER-CITY COMMUNITY PARALEGAL NETWORK Approximately 67% of urban populations in Nigeria live in informal settlements and are caught in a poverty trap characterized by marginalization and insecurity. Communities lack access to basic services and security of tenure and they face discrimination and threats of physical violence. Ethnic minorities, urban migrants, and women are particularly vulnerable to social and political exclusion. To date, approaches to urban development have emphasized policies of decongestion, formalization of informal settlements, or beautification, which have often resulted in arrests, forced evictions, and demolitions of informal settlement communities. Many people living on the margins of Nigeria's cities have struggled to exercise their basic rights.   Against that backdrop, this project aims to address some of the most critical justice and governance challenges facing Nigeria's urban poor. The research builds on five years of experience of an innovative inter-city network of community paralegals, trained and supported by Justice and Empowerment Initiatives – Nigeria. The network currently serves over 100 informal settlements (slums) in Lagos and Port Harcourt.    The research will comprise three streams. First, the team will identify the priority justice challenges experienced by informal settlement residents, with their direct participation. Another stream will study the immediate costs and longer-term impacts of these justice challenges on residents, with a view to understanding their relationship with the poverty trap. A final stream will explore the broader societal costs of current urban policy approaches and will conduct cost-benefit analyses on proposed alternatives. Research findings will be used to identify and test legal empowerment strategies to improve urban poor communities' capacity to respond to priority justice challenges.

It mentions 'shelter' briefly as part of the interagency Flash Appeal, which covers various urgent needs including food, shelter, emergency health assistance, etc. The appeal is to address immediate humanitarian requirements rather than directly addressing housing provision or homelessness services per se.

The text specifically outlines health-related activities by WHO: treating the wounded and trauma-affected individuals, providing reproductive health services, and coordinating health cluster responses for emergencies. These are not explicitly related to housing construction or upgrading but pertain more to emergency healthcare needs.

However, given that 'shelter' is mentioned in the context of humanitarian aid, it could potentially align with broader definitions involving provision of basic shelter during emergencies. The text does mention locations (West Bank and Gaza), which could link to urban contexts if these are considered significant urban settings. No explicit description of homelessness services like tents or shelters for the homeless is provided.

In summary, while 'shelter' appears in the context of humanitarian needs, it is not specified as permanent housing provision or upgrading, nor are there direct mentions of transitional housing solutions or incremental improvements.

However, since no specific types of housing (such as construction or upgrading) are mentioned, the direct connection to 'Housing' is weak.

The mention of these cities indicates the activities are likely taking place within an urban context. However, the project sectors listed include 'Food security and livelihoods', 'Protection Shelter and settlements', and 'WASH' (Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene), which suggests a broad scope of services that could potentially intersect with housing-related aspects such as shelter provision or settlement improvement.

The term 'Shelter and settlements' within the sectors may imply involvement in transitional shelters or incremental improvements to existing settlements. This could suggest potential relevance to both 'Transitional' and 'Incremental' classes, depending on whether the focus is on temporary arrangements for displaced persons (which would be more aligned with 'Transitional') or on upgrading existing inadequate housing or neighborhoods ('Incremental').

There is no explicit mention of homelessness, social housing models such as community land trusts or cooperative housing, market-driven housing activities like mortgages or rent-to-own schemes, nor rural initiatives. Given the urban locations specified and the sectors involved, there's a clear indication that this project may fall under 'Urban' due to its geographical focus.

While it is possible for urban development projects to include elements of housing provision (which could link it to the 'Housing' class), without explicit mention or further details in the title or description, we cannot conclusively categorize it as such. The information given does not explicitly detail any activities related directly to permanent housing construction or policy.

Let's consider each classification:
- Housing: There is no explicit mention of activities related to the provision or improvement of housing itself; hence, this does not fit.
- Homelessness: The text doesn't discuss any direct support for homeless individuals like shelters or encampments, so it doesn't match this class.
- Transitional: No mention of emergency shelters, refugee camps, or temporary supportive housing is made here.
- Incremental: While slum upgrading might be inferred from the focus on 'slum areas,' there's no explicit mention of housing site development, technical assistance for housing, or structural repairs.

1. **Cultural Heritage**: This aspect does not directly relate to any of the classes such as housing, homelessness, or market-specific topics.
2. **Tourism**: Similar to cultural heritage, tourism is typically unrelated to direct classifications like homelessness, transitional housing, etc., although it could indirectly impact urban development and rural areas.
3. **Urban Development**: This term explicitly aligns with activities that relate to 'Housing' as defined by the task. It involves city planning, infrastructure improvements, and potentially the construction of new housing or upgrading existing facilities within an urban environment.

Based on this analysis, the key focus relevant to our classification is 'urban development,' which directly ties into the 'Housing' category. Additionally, since it specifies a geographic location (Jordan), which can include both urban and rural areas, there might be relevance to 'Urban.' However, without more specific information indicating activities in non-urban parts of Jordan, this broader category may not be definitively assigned.

Support to Chernobyl Shelter Fund. New Safe Confinement Project.,23510,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"The title 'Support to Chernobyl Shelter Fund. New Safe Confinement Project.' involves activities related to the Chernobyl disaster site, specifically focusing on shelter projects such as the New Safe Confinement over the damaged reactor. This can be considered within the realm of housing because it involves provision and upgrading of a significant structure meant for safety and containment purposes. It doesn't explicitly refer to traditional human housing or living accommodations but aligns more closely with structural construction in a unique context, which could fit under 'Housing' due to its focus on providing a protective enclosure (a form of shelter). There are no indications that this is related directly to homelessness, transitional shelters for people, incremental housing efforts like slum upgrading, social housing such as public housing or land trusts, market housing solutions like mortgages, or specifically urban or rural location activities. Thus, the primary classification aligns with 'Housing'.",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False
