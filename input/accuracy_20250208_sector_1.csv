"FIGHT FOR PEACE INTERNATIONAL Primary goal (Comic Relief): Children and young people at risk. Related issues (Comic Relief): NULL. Summary: In Mare favela, one of the most dangerous slums in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, drug-related gun violence is the primary cause of death of young people. Key drivers for youth participation in crime and violence include poverty, low levels of education, social marginalisation, violence from state forces and armed groups, dysfunctional families, and a lack of leisure facilities. This project will extend a tried and tested approach that offers personal development, sports, education and employment opportunities and social support services to vulnerable young people in the favela, enabling young people to realise their full potential and increasing social cohesion and peace in the target communities.

1. **Housing**: The description does not explicitly mention the provision of housing or shelter in any form. Thus, it doesn't meet the criteria for this classification.

2. **Homelessness**: There is no mention of tents, encampments, or shelters specifically for the homeless. Therefore, it does not fit into this category.

3. **Transitional**: The description does not refer to emergency shelters, refugee shelters, camps, or temporary supportive housing, so it's not relevant here.

- There is no explicit mention of housing, provision of shelter, or housing-related activities such as upgrading inadequate housing or construction.
- The description does not explicitly discuss homelessness issues like tents for the homeless, encampments, or shelters specifically meant for the homeless.
- It mentions assistance provided at migration stations and to those who do not attend shelters. This could hint at a transitional aspect due to its focus on temporary accommodations (shelters) but lacks explicit references to emergency or refugee-specific shelters.
- There's no mention of incremental housing activities like slum upgrading or structural repairs.
- The activity doesn't explicitly describe social, market, urban, or rural housing initiatives. While it mentions migration stations and those not attending shelters, these are more related to the transitional aspect rather than directly indicating any specific housing class.

- **Transitional**: This class covers emergency shelters or temporary housing solutions like refugee camps. While there is a mention of providing facilities to crisis-affected people, these are not described as transitional living arrangements but rather improvements in essential services.

- **Incremental**: Encompasses upgrading or improving existing facilities or infrastructure, such as slum upgrades or neighborhood integration efforts.

- **Social**: Refers to community land trusts, cooperative housing, or public housing initiatives. The project does not appear to involve these social housing structures but rather focuses on basic service provision.

- **Market**: Involves home rental markets, mortgages, or market-rate housing. There is no mention of market mechanisms in the activity description.

- **Urban**: Pertains specifically to urban locations for development activities. The text does not specify whether the projects are in urban areas; it mentions the department of Nariño but does not elaborate on its urban or rural nature.

- **Rural**: Focuses on specific rural location-based development activities. Again, while Nariño is mentioned, there's no clear indication that these efforts are specifically targeting rural settings.

Het militaire partnerschap met de Democratische Republiek Congo omvat vooral de vorming van, toezicht op en evaluatie van een 'URR' brigade (Unité de Réaction Rapide  - een soort paracommando's) bestaande uit drie elite bataljons (321e, 322e en 323e Bataillons de Réaction Rapide) te Kindu, naast de vorming, de begeleiding en evaluatie van de onderrichters van de Militaire Academie van Kananga en van de Genieschool in Likasi. Het 321e bataljon werd eind 2008-begin 2009 gevormd te Kananga, het 322e bataljon eind 2011-begin 2012 te Kindu en tenslotte het 323e bataljon in de loop van 2013 te Kindu. Blijft nog de vorming van de staf van de brigade die de drie gevormde elite bataljons zal omkaderen. Wanneer een militair in de Democratische Republiek Congo een standplaats krijgt toegewezen om er tijdelijk te verblijven, trekt zijn gezin bijna altijd mee. Deze verplaatsingen resulteren vaak in moeilijke levensomstandigheden voor de families. Die families dienen op zoek te gaan naar een onderkomen, naar gezondheidszorgen, naar een school voor hun kinderen en naar landbouwgrond om voedsel te kunnen produceren. Dit gebeurt vaak ten koste van de lokale populatie met conflicten als gevolg. Om aan deze tendens een halt toe te roepen, willen de Congolese regering en de Stafdienst van het leger (FARDC – Forces Armées de la République Démocratique du Congo) de militairen en hun gezin een vaste woonplaats bezorgen. Het is de bedoeling de militairen te huisvesten in garnizoensteden verspreid over het hele land. Zo zullen de militairen die op missie vertrekken, gerust gesteld zijn dat hun familie veilig en degelijk gehuisvest is.Kindu gelegen in de provincie Maniema is één van die garnizoensteden.

The project explicitly mentions the development of military camps into suitable housing areas, highlighting efforts in infrastructural rehabilitation specifically for housing purposes. This activity is part of a larger security consolidation effort in Eastern DRC and Maniema province, but the core activities described are centered around providing stable residential solutions for military families.

There is no mention of homelessness services like tents or shelters; transitional solutions such as emergency or refugee camps are not relevant here since these are permanent housing solutions within military camps. Incremental housing, which involves upgrading existing slums or small structural repairs, does not apply directly here either because the focus is on constructing new accommodations rather than incrementally improving existing ones.

Una mirada palestina al valle del Jordán :: Desde 1948 el Estado de Israel inició la Nakba, un proceso de desplazamiento forzoso y violento de la población palestina de sus lugares de origen. Esta estrategia que se manifiesta de diferentes maneras (sistema de permisos, zonificación, segregación, confiscación de tierras, denegación de acceso a recursos y servicios, supresión de la resistencia, debilitamiento de la identidad, entre otras) busca el debilitamiento de la identidad nacional y la resistencia colectiva, afectando especialmente el relevo generacional y los mecanismos de resistencia comunitarios. El desplazamiento interno y refugio de la población palestina ha condicionado su acceso a servicios básicos y medios de vida ante la dependencia del mercado de trabajo israelí y la ayuda humanitaria en los campamentos de refugiados. Adicionalmente, su sociedad es ampliamente conservadora y patriarcal, lo cual relega a los jóvenes y mujeres a un segundo plano. Se estima que casi el 30% de la población palestina es joven (15-29 años), pese al alto nivel de alfabetización la juventud debe hacer frente a altas tasas de desempleo (40%), asimismo, las mujeres jóvenes sufren con frecuencia un contexto doblemente opresor de sus derechos y libertades que les impide implicarse y participar en la lucha por la liberación palestina.

"PROMOTING LEGAL EMPOWERMENT OF THE URBAN POOR IN NIGERIA THROUGH AN INTER-CITY COMMUNITY PARALEGAL NETWORK Approximately 67% of urban populations in Nigeria live in informal settlements and are caught in a poverty trap characterized by marginalization and insecurity. Communities lack access to basic services and security of tenure and they face discrimination and threats of physical violence. Ethnic minorities, urban migrants, and women are particularly vulnerable to social and political exclusion. To date, approaches to urban development have emphasized policies of decongestion, formalization of informal settlements, or beautification, which have often resulted in arrests, forced evictions, and demolitions of informal settlement communities. Many people living on the margins of Nigeria's cities have struggled to exercise their basic rights.   Against that backdrop, this project aims to address some of the most critical justice and governance challenges facing Nigeria's urban poor. The research builds on five years of experience of an innovative inter-city network of community paralegals, trained and supported by Justice and Empowerment Initiatives – Nigeria. The network currently serves over 100 informal settlements (slums) in Lagos and Port Harcourt.    The research will comprise three streams. First, the team will identify the priority justice challenges experienced by informal settlement residents, with their direct participation. Another stream will study the immediate costs and longer-term impacts of these justice challenges on residents, with a view to understanding their relationship with the poverty trap. A final stream will explore the broader societal costs of current urban policy approaches and will conduct cost-benefit analyses on proposed alternatives. Research findings will be used to identify and test legal empowerment strategies to improve urban poor communities' capacity to respond to priority justice challenges.

- 'Incremental': There is no mention of housing sites, technical assistance, slum upgrading, structural repairs, or neighborhood integration. Therefore, this does not apply.
- 'Social': While there is communal support provided by the maternal home, it doesn't fit the explicit definition of social housing types like community land trusts or public housing.
- 'Market': The text does not reference any market-based housing activities such as rentals, mortgages, or rent-to-own schemes. Thus, this class is inapplicable.

- **Homelessness**: No specific mention of tents for the homeless, encampments, or homeless shelters is made.
- **Transitional**: The use of 'shelter' could imply emergency shelters, but there's no explicit description of such facilities being set up as transitional housing like refugee camps or temporary supportive housing.
- **Incremental**: There’s no mention of housing sites, structural repairs, slum upgrading, etc., which are indicative of incremental approaches to improving living conditions.
- **Social**: No reference to community land trusts, cooperative housing, or public housing is made.
- **Market**: Market-related housing activities like home-rental, mortgages, or rent-to-own options are not mentioned.

Residents of Africa's urban informal settlements are at elevated risk for poor sexual and reproductive health and rights, unintended pregnancies, unsafe abortion, and sexual and gender-based violence.

The specific subcategories listed include shelter and settlements as part of the broader material relief assistance and services. This indicates an involvement with housing-related activities, likely aimed at providing temporary or immediate solutions for those affected by crises.

The term 'Shelter and settlements' implies that there is some provision of living accommodations or structures to offer protection against environmental elements, which aligns well with several categories in the expanded definition provided:
- **Transitional**: This class includes emergency shelters, refugee shelters, refugee camps, or temporary supportive housing. Given the crisis context and rapid response mechanism mentioned, it's reasonable to infer that these activities involve providing some form of transitional shelter for displaced or vulnerable populations.

It doesn't explicitly mention homelessness (e.g., tents for homeless, encampments, or homeless shelters) in a manner focused on chronic conditions but rather an emergency response. The context suggests more alignment with temporary solutions like those seen in transitional settings than permanent housing projects or long-term social housing programs.

The activity's urban or rural classification cannot be confirmed without specific geographic details beyond the country name (Sudan), although Sudan includes both urban and rural areas, it doesn't provide sufficient evidence to determine one over the other based on the provided description. Therefore, 'Urban' and 'Rural' classifications are not applicable with certainty.

The descriptions do not suggest market activities such as home-rental or mortgages since they focus on crisis response rather than regular economic housing transactions.

This description suggests a focus on emergency assistance in response to population movements due to armed conflict. The sectors mentioned are 'Protection Shelter and settlements WASH', which gives more context for classification.

The key terms here include 'emergency assistance' and 'movements of populations,' likely indicating temporary or provisional support structures such as shelters. This aligns with definitions provided under the 'Transitional' class, which includes emergency shelters and refugee camps as explicitly described categories. Additionally, since this is in response to a conflict situation, it suggests temporary housing solutions rather than permanent construction.

The sector description also mentions 'Shelter and settlements,' reinforcing that some form of transitional living arrangements might be involved. The term 'WASH' (Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene) usually accompanies shelter provision efforts to ensure basic human needs are met in crisis situations, often seen in emergency or temporary settings.

Given these considerations, the most fitting classification based on the provided definition is likely 'Transitional'.

While this involves aspects of safety and structural repairs, it does not directly relate to any of the housing sector classes such as provision or upgrading of living spaces, housing policy, homelessness solutions, transitional shelters, incremental housing improvements, social housing models, market-rate housing initiatives, or specific urban or rural housing activities.

The Chernobyl Shelter Fund is primarily concerned with nuclear safety and engineering rather than directly providing shelter or improving housing conditions for people. As such, it does not fit the categories of Housing, Homelessness, Transitional, Incremental, Social, Market, Urban, or Rural as defined in the context of development and humanitarian activity related to the housing sector.",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False
